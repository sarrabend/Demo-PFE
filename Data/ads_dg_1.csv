0, Liz Truss ‘will approve more oil drilling if she becomes PM’,"Tory leadership candidate criticised by campaigners after reports her team have met energy firms

Politics live – latest updates
","Liz Truss will sign off on a push for more oil drilling in the North Sea if she wins the Conservative leadership election, according to reports, drawing criticism from environmental campaigners.Amid mounting public dismay about soaring energy bills, Truss’s policy advisers are thought to be discussing proposals to issue up to 130 new drilling licences, which typically take nearly three decades to produce any oil and gas.The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, and the Brexit opportunities minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg, have been meeting oil and gas firms to discuss how to secure energy supplies this winter, the Times reported.Truss’s plans to slash VAT are ‘regressive and flawed’, says Sunak’s teamRead moreThe discussions reportedly involve importing more gas from Norway in the short term, while ramping up domestic production. The climate change committee has previously said it takes an average of 28 years for an exploration licence to lead to oil and gas production.The Greenpeace chief UK scientist, Dr Doug Parr, said intensifying North Sea drilling would do little to bring down energy bills.“Unleashing a North Sea drilling frenzy isn’t a plan to help bill payers but a gift to the fossil fuel giants already making billions from this crisis,” he said.“New oil and gas could take a quarter of a century to pump out, will be eventually sold at global prices, and have no real impact on energy bills yet still fuel the climate crisis.”He said the UK’s dependence on gas was among the factors driving up bills and called for faster action to promote new wind and solar projects, as well as improving energy efficiency by insulating UK homes, which are among the leakiest in Europe.Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDeskHe added: “If Liz Truss really wants to help cash-strapped households, she should bring in an energy bill freeze alongside extra financial support for the poorest households, partly funded by properly taxing the astronomical profits of oil and gas companies.”Truss’s North Sea plan comes against the backdrop of a continent-wide scramble to secure gas supplies before the winter, after Vladimir Putin began choking off pipeline flows amid a geopolitical standoff over his invasion of Ukraine.The UK relies more heavily on gas than most European countries and has very little storage after the closure of the Rough facility off the Yorkshire coast in 2017. Labour has previously called on Truss to explain her part in the government’s acquiescence to the closure of Rough.","**Headline:** Liz Truss Plans to Approve More Oil Drilling

1,Renewed Highland golf course plan has environmentalists crying 'Fore!',Scottish government rejected a new links at Coul to protect the complex dune system but investors have revived the scheme,"It is an area so tranquil that the notion of bitter dispute is hugely anomalous. The serenity of Coul - in east Sutherland, north of Dornoch – is in fact fundamental to a backdrop of unrest.When the Scottish government rejected a plan for a golf course at Coul early last year, it appeared those with grand plans had nowhere else to turn. This marked a victory for environmentalists who argued one of the most complex dune systems in Scotland and a site of special scientific interest (SSSI) should not be compromised. “The harmful impacts to protected habitats and species would outweigh the potential socio-economic benefits,” said Kevin Stewart, then planning minister. Anne McCall, the director of RSPB Scotland, said: “These damaging proposals threatened a site of global importance for nature and should never have made it this far.”The rich v the very, very rich: the rebellion at Wentworth golf clubRead moreWith American investors key to the project, comparisons were not unreasonably – if unhelpfully to those pursuing a golf course – drawn with Donald Trump’s controversial development in Aberdeenshire. One glance across social media illustrates the depth of feeling attached to Coul and acrimony as attached. One golfer’s paradise is someone else’s idea of vandalism on sacred land.Unbowed, a group of individuals want to bring Coul Links back before the planners. Edward Abel Smith, a London-based landowner, is working in conjunction with the newly formed Communities for Coul. He now wants to build an eco-friendly hotel and will, should planning be granted, hand over his territory for 18 holes at a long-term peppercorn rent. The multimillion dollar question, though, is why this scheme will succeed now when the previous one in early 2020 so publicly failed?“I wouldn’t say we are confident but we feel strongly about the overall benefits that the development would bring,” says Communities for Coul’s Gordon Sutherland. “We want this golf course as a catalyst for economic development. The number of jobs forecast are calculated by businesses prepared to invest; there is almost £50m of private investment lined up and 180 jobs, 108 of which would be full-time.“It would be such an important thing for this area, which had a decreasing population and ageing demographic even before Covid. It’s even more important now to create jobs in this area. We are prepared to fail but we will do everything we can to succeed.”Several developers are interested in this scheme but, once again, it hinges on planning consent. It will be several months before a new application is submitted. Abel Smith admits he is currently presiding over a “loss-making farm”. The issue is, protected links land adjacent to the farm is fundamental for a renowned golf course. “The land has been in my family for a long time,” he says. “I genuinely believe the course is the best option for the area, whilst admitting my vested interest by way of the hotel. I will go as far as the community take this. I don’t see there being other options to benefit the land, the area or the environment in any comparable way.”Highland councillors have previously offered heavy backing. The appetite within Sutherland for the golf course appears strong. “Of the 90,000 or so who signed the online petition against the [rejected] development, less than 0.15% live within the IV25 postcode,” say Communities for Coul. Sutherland adds: “We feel the vast majority of people who live locally support this.” Politically, the prominence or otherwise of the Scottish Greens after upcoming elections could be significant.That Tom Dargie, an ecologist and the chair of Not Coul sits in the opposite camp to Sutherland and Abel Smith feels like gross understatement. Dargie had previously estimated the loss of 48 hectares of dune habitat, should the course go ahead.“As before, sound economics with decent science and respect for protected land are awol from the Coul golf revival plan,” Dargie insists. “Not Coul individuals, possibly with new objectives under a new name, want to campaign for community-led management of all protected wildlife and habitats at Coul Links. We want to enable a vibrant, dynamic, golf-free and self-functioning dune ecosystem, with community initiatives involving many nearby, outside designated land. In short we seek respectful change and living-wage jobs approved by the majority in our community whilst doing no damage to our local supposedly protected environment.”Dargie believes precious little has changed between the rejection of the previous plan and the arrival of Communities for Coul. He adds: “Much is being made in the press of damage to the local economy from Covid-19 lockdown and Brexit but those claims lack substance and are without proven information on local severe effects which are worse than elsewhere in Scotland. Instead, based on the local business results from the restricted 2020 staycation summer, other unquoted local business people feel our economy here will likely boom in staycation 2021 because it is already geared to family tourism, couples and golf on really excellent courses.” True though that may be, it of course ignores the longer term.Where Dargie and Abel Smith do agree is on the poor and overgrown condition of a protected site due to no management plan being in place with NatureScot, previously Scottish Natural Heritage. “I have a productive relationship with NatureScot,” adds Abel Smith. “But they are incredibly stretched.“I haven’t deliberately neglected the land. I would love to see it protected and looked after properly. In my view a golf course is the best way to do that; it takes up a small area and would provide capital to maintain the rest of the SSSI.”Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.In nearby Royal Dornoch, Sutherland houses one of the finest golf venues in the world. Its vice-captain, the professor of economics David Bell, has sent a letter to the local MP, Jamie Stone, regarding golf and the post-pandemic scene. “The golf courses around the Dornoch Firth can play a vital role in recovery from what has been the most devastating economic collapse to affect this area, possibly since the Clearances [eviction of Highland tenants in the 18th and 19th centuries],” says Bell. “The golf industry provides vital employment, allowing younger people to stay in the area. This is particularly important in Sutherland, which faces serious demographic decline. By 2040, its population is likely to be around half of what it was at the time of the Clearances. Highland Council’s own estimates show Sutherland’s population declining by 10.7% between 2021 and 2041.”Dornoch, just like the neighbouring and excellent courses at Golspie, Tain and Brora would benefit from increased footfall. In short, the economic argument here is compelling. Whether that is sufficient to circumvent lingering and deep environmental concerns remains to be seen.","**Headline:** The Battle Over Coul Links: Economic Growth vs. Environmental Protection

2," Visiting green spaces deters mental health drug use, researchers find","Positive effects were stronger among those reporting the lowest annual household income, says Finnish study","Visits to parks, community gardens and other urban green spaces may lower city dwellers’ use of drugs for anxiety, insomnia, depression, high blood pressure, and asthma, research has found.Researchers in Finland found that visiting such areas three to four times a week cuts people’s chances of turning to drugs for mental health problems or high blood pressure by a third, and for asthma by about a quarter.Moreover, the positive effects of visiting green spaces were stronger among those reporting the lowest annual household income, the researchers found.Scientist enlists pupils to see how hedges can make greener schoolsRead moreThe findings correlate with a growing body of evidence that a lack of access to green spaces is linked to a range of health problems. Access tends to be unequal, with poorer communities having fewer opportunities to be in nature.To investigate the link, researchers from the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare drew on the responses of 16,000 randomly selected residents of Helsinki, Espoo and Vantaa – three cities that make up the largest urban area in Finland – to the Helsinki capital region environmental health survey in 2015-16.The survey gathered information on how city dwellers aged at least 25 experienced residential green and blue spaces within a 1km (0.62-mile) radius of their homes. Green areas included forests, gardens, parks, castle parks, cemeteries, zoos, natural grasslands, moors and wetlands; and blue areas included sea, lakes, and rivers.Respondents were asked to report their use of prescribed drugs for anxiety, insomnia and depression, and for high blood pressure and asthma. They were then asked how often they spent time or exercised outdoors in green spaces, during May and September, with options ranging from never to five or more times a week.The researchers chose prescription drugs as a proxy for ill health. They picked those for anxiety, insomnia and depression, and high blood pressure and asthma in particular because they are used to treat common but potentially serious health issues.They found a strong correlation between visits to green spaces and lower odds of using such drugs. Compared with less than one weekly visit, visiting three to four times weekly was associated with 33% lower odds of using mental health drugs, 36% lower odds of using blood pressure drugs, and 26% lower odds of using asthma drugs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

3,Bought too much red cabbage? Turn it into a festive nut roast – recipe,This fantastic vegan centrepiece makes full use of those outer cabbage leaves that all too often just get thrown away,"I devised today’s nut roast for Oddbox, a veg box outfit that supports farmers by buying wonky fruit and veg that they might otherwise find hard to shift. It’s moist, flavourful and a fun use for outer cabbage leaves, which often get thrown away; it’s also a wonderful vegan centrepiece for a celebratory table.Chest-nut roastThe outer leaves from a cabbage, which are all too often pulled off and discarded, are the ideal tool for wrapping a nut roast, and help keep the filling moist. Nut roast can sometimes be a little dry and unsatisfying, but this version, featuring chestnuts, has a lovely, moist texture and tastes meaty and satisfying because of thesage, nutmeg and Marmite; inspired by recipes for vegan haggis, I’ve also added barley and lentils.Although delicious when fresh, I think it’s even better if made a couple of days in advance, giving it time to set firmly and for the flavours to develop as they mingle. Once baked, it will keep in the fridge for up to five days, or freeze indefinitely (defrost in the fridge overnight). Reheat at 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5 for 30 minutes, until piping hot right through.If you have any leftovers, turn them into a rich soup: finely chop the red cabbage casing, then add to a pan with the crumbled up filling and enough boiling water to create a thick soup. Return to a boil, then serve.Prep 1 hrCook 1 hr 35 minServes 4-62 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for greasing2 shallots, peeled and finely diced (about 140g)1 rainbow carrot, grated with the skin on (about 140g)180g cooked and peeled chestnuts, roughly chopped2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed40g sunflower seeds1 tsp thyme leaves½ tbsp chopped sage leaves1 tsp ground coriander¼ tsp nutmeg50g black or green lentils50g pearl barley, or rice2 tsp Marmite40g pinhead oats, or rolled oats40g ground almondsSea salt and black pepper4-5 outer red cabbage leavesPut the olive oil in a pan on medium heat, then saute the shallots and grated carrot for 10 minutes. Stir in the chestnuts, garlic, sunflower seeds, thyme, sage, ground coriander and nutmeg, then add the lentils and pearl barley. Stir in the Marmite and 350ml water, cover, bring up to a boil, then turn down to a simmer and cook for 35 minutes, or until the barley and lentils are very tender and the texture is like a dry risotto. Stir in the oats and almonds, then season generously.Meanwhile, in a large pan of boiling water, blanch the red cabbage leaves for five minutes, then drain.Grease a 1kg bread tin or enamel dish with olive oil, then line it with the cabbage leaves, making sure they overlap. Tightly pack the chestnut mixture into the cabbage-lined vessel, then fold the overhanging leaves over the top, so sealing the filling inside. Bake in a 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 oven for 45 minutes, then remove and leave to settle and rest for at least five minutes. Carefully turn out on to a serving board, then take to the table, slice and serve with all the Christmas trimmings.","**Headline:** Transform Leftover Red Cabbage into a Festive Delight

4,‘This year has been very good’: readers’ UK butterfly sightings,"Readers share their favourite sightings over the summer, after news that numbers have risen since last year

UK butterfly numbers bounce back after last year’s all-time low
","‘Constant companions to our gardening’A peacock butterfly perched on a yellow ragwort, pictured on 9 August. Photograph: Guardian communityWe try to encourage as many pollinators as possible to visit our allotment. As well as growing lots of fruit and veg we have planted many different flowers. Across the summer we saw some unusual moths, such as the ghost moth, and then from August onwards the butterflies started to appear. We mostly spotted red admiral, peacock and small tortoiseshell butterflies. They particularly liked the cosmos and the corn marigolds. They also liked the ragwort, which later had cinnabar moth caterpillars. On sunny days they were constant companions to our gardening. Although we have seen large white butterflies, too, we don’t seem to have had any problems with caterpillars eating our veg. This may be beginner’s luck. Jess and Ian, Scottish Borders ‘I was delighted by the numbers of butterflies’A brown argus butterfly, pictured on 17 July. Photograph: Allan Ferguson/Guardian communityI allowed the grass on the lawn to the front of my house to grow and I planted some wild flowers into it, field scabious, knapweed, bird’s foot trefoil and meadow cranesbill among others. I was delighted by the numbers of butterflies that came to nectar on the flowers, there were lots of meadow browns, gatekeepers, common blues, large and small whites – but I was especially pleased to see about a dozen brown argus, which took up home here for most of July and August. I have been searching for their eggs or caterpillars on the cranesbills, so far without success, but I shall keep looking as it would be nice to know whether they are breeding here. Allan Ferguson, Bishops Stortford, Hertfordshire ‘I was lucky enough to see 11 different species’Marie’s sightings at RSPB Minsmere on 16 July. Photograph: Marie Baynham-Davies/Guardian communityOver the summer I went to RSPB Minsmere, mainly to look for rare bird species, but on one visit on 16 July I was lucky enough to see 11 different species of butterfly. I sadly didn’t see a small tortoiseshell all summer, though, which used to be one of the most common to spot. Most of the butterflies were on or near nettles and brambles, showing the importance of leaving wild parts in gardens.The rarest of those 11 species is probably the white admiral (top right, circled in red). It’s only the second time I’ve seen one, so I was really happy. I believe the silver-washed fritillary is fairly common, if you know where to look, but I’ve never had one in my garden so it was exciting to see it, too. My favourite is the peacock, bottom right. It’s one of the more common butterflies but so beautiful; it looks tropical and exotic. Marie Baynham-Davies, Halesworth, Suffolk ‘At least a dozen red admirals at one time’A red admiral spotted on Sean’s fig tree on 11 September. Photograph: Sean O’Sullivan/Guardian communityA comma butterfly, pictured on 8 September 2023. Photograph: Sean O’Sullivan/Guardian communityOur fig tree has had a bumper crop this year. We were away for a week visiting family and found that quite a lot of the ripe fruit had gone beyond the ideal picking stage, and insects such as tiny flies and wood lice had begun to feast on them. Most notable, though, was the profusion of wasps and red admiral butterflies gorging themselves on the very overripe fruits. They were often sharing the same single fruit, and from time to time flying around before settling back on that same one or elsewhere in the tree.We’ve still been able to pick more than enough for ourselves and to give to friends, so it’s been a real treat to share so much with the insects this year. There must have been at least a dozen red admirals at one time, and a few speckled woods trying to chase them away. I also saw one comma. Sean O’Sullivan, Banbury, Oxfordshire ‘It has certainly been a good year’A painted lady on Verbena bonariensis, pictured on 12 September. Photograph: Sally Twiss/Guardian communityIt has certainly been a good year for butterflies in our south-facing garden: we’ve seen red admiral, peacock, gatekeeper and various whites in numbers. Comma, small tortoiseshell, brimstone, speckled wood, orange tip and dark green fritillary (also hummingbird hawk moths) were also present. They were attracted by plenty of nectar-rich flowers and food plants, such as nettles and hedge garlic. Sally Twiss, the Blackdown Hills, south-west England ‘A very rare sighting’The Camberwell beauty, photographed on 18 July.We saw a Camberwell beauty in our garden on 18 July at 11.58am. We took it at a distance so as not to disturb it. We reported the sighting to the Dorset Butterfly Conservation organisation and the photograph was published on their gallery. It is my understanding that a Camberwell beauty is a very rare sighting as there is no evidence that it breeds in this country. Geoff Pike, 70, Dorset ‘They are plentiful in our area’A marbled white butterfly on Ventnor Down on 8 July 2023. Photograph: Guardian communityThis photo of a marbled white butterfly was taken on Ventnor Down on 8 July 2023. On the same day I also saw a small copper, common blue and a six-spot burnet moth. In my view, this year has been very good for butterflies as they are plentiful in our area. We live adjacent to downland so we are well placed to observe wildlife.

5,"Country diary: Willow tits are here, but good luck with seeing one","Tittesworth Reservoir, Staffordshire: It’s easy to see why these wonderful but maddeningly elusive birds have inspired great poetry","The numerous bird feeders here are permanently stocked and flocked around by garden birds. Long-tailed, blue, coal and great tits pop up every second or so; and sparrows come and go with goldfinches, while reed buntings and nuthatches slip in and out among the gaps. But the briefest, most maddening, if most wonderful of all, are the willow tits.I see them usually not as they arrive, but as they leave. They zip in, but intermittently and invariably when you’ve dropped your guard. Again! All they gift you is a mean, hard, visiting call – the driest avian sound in Britain – an invertebrate Zi zi taah taah, like the small complaint of an angry insect.Despite willow tits retaining wide breeding presence through middle England, most people never see them, partly because this verve-filled fidget is so elusive, but also because it has an identical twin – the marsh tit. Almost all features said to be diagnostic of one or the other I have recorded on the wrong species. They’re so alike that not a single Briton twigged there were two black-capped, caramel-backed tits here, until two German ornithologists put us all straight in 1911.Alas for us, this never-you-see-me bird is going again. Willow tits have declined by 94% since 1970 and half of its old range is now blank. Yet continental willow tits recur throughout Eurasia’s woodlands from Amsterdam to Vladivostok. So does it matter? It matters to the poet Steve Ely, who dedicated the slenderest volume to the willow tit with his wonderful pamphlet Zi-zi Taah Taah Taah. Few British birds, except Ted Hughes’ mythopoeic Crow perhaps, are so honoured with poetry that is so densely allusive yet of such thematic grandeur. It is a sort of Waste Land for the willow tit.Try to see the beast and you’ll know why Ely wrote with such passion and why willow tits so deserve a place in our poetry and our land. But the best spot I know to do it is here, where the strange, disconcerting context makes it seem like meeting a small beloved god – say, Vincent van Gogh – in the queue at McDonald’s.

6, Scaly stowaway: lizard makes an appearance at Chelsea flower show,Gardeners at the Yeo Valley Organic display were delighted to find the common brown lizard in a pile of logs,"Visitors to Chelsea flower show come from all over the country, and range from senior royals to interested gardeners looking for some new plants.This year, however, there has been a rather special guest – a common brown lizard. Gardeners at the Yeo Valley Organic display were delighted to find him in a pile of logs.In the past, Chelsea was known as a showcase of perfectly manicured lawns and prize-winning blooms in symmetrical flower beds. But there is now a clear trend towards nature-friendly gardening. This has been somewhat controversial, with veteran gardeners including the Royal Horticultural Society rose expert Charles Quest-Ritson arguing that people do not attend flower shows to see piles of logs and patches of nettles. He believes prizes should not be given for “weeds”.But Quest-Ritson is in the minority, and this year’s show features multitudes of nature and eco-friendly gardens including a Cop26 garden and a woodland planting supported by Prince Charles, which urges visitors to “plant a tree for the Queen”.Late flowering: the Chelsea flower show is finally back – but what will it look like in autumn?Read moreYeo Valley Organic’s garden is built to attract amphibians and reptiles, as well as pollinators and insects. It seems to have achieved that aim, with the lizard making himself at home in the log pile.Sarah Mead, who created the Yeo Valley Organic garden, which is a permanent fixture at the company’s farm in Somerset, said there had been a discussion about whether the lizard had hitchhiked from the farm, where materials from the original garden were transported for the mini Chelsea version, or whether had it crawled in as a rare example of a London lizard.She said: “It’s definitely a common brown lizard – there are lots of them in the West Country so we are sure it came down from Yeo Valley in Somerset among the stone that was transported from the farm, but it’s made itself quite at home here.“As lizards are cold-blooded, they like the stone – it’s Mendip stone they’ve brought up from the dry stone walls on the farm, so a perfect environment for lizards, cool with lots of nooks and crannies. Lizards are just one example of the rich biodiversity at Yeo Valley, where they do everything to encourage wildlife.”Common lizards are found across the country, but their numbers are declining because of habitat loss. They thrive in grassland and moorland, as well as the edges of woodlands.The gardeners have enlisted experts from the Wildlife Trusts to help them keep the lizard comfortable at the busy show and teach them more about it.Features of the Somerset garden recreated at Chelsea include an open perennial meadow with flowering plants and a glade of silver birch. The design also features charred logs used as garden markers and rammed earth walls as boundaries, both highlighting the importance of soil health. The garden is designed to show how to create a beautiful and peaceful space that encourages nature and has soil health in mind. Tom Massey, who with the help of Mead designed the show garden, said: “The soil plays a pivotal role in our fight to reverse climate change but the world of microscopic activity under our feet is often overlooked. Carbon is the building block of all life and as gardeners we need to be reminded of the role we play in locking carbon into the soil, where it can help sustain life for generations to come.

7," Climate crisis could lead to rise of smaller bees, study finds","Danger looms for larger species such as bumblebees, which have lower heat tolerance, leading to ‘cascading effects’ on ecosystems","The climate crisis could lead to more small-bodied bees but fewer bumblebees, according to research warning of potential “cascading” effects on plant pollination and across whole ecosystems.Scientists in the US trapped and studied more than 20,000 bees over eight years in an area of the Rocky Mountains to find out how different types reacted to changing climatic conditions.In research published on Wednesday in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, the authors said that while environmental conditions varied from year to year, the sub-alpine region from which they took samples was “particularly vulnerable to climate change”, with generally warming spring temperatures and earlier snow melt.Fears for bees as US set to extend use of toxic pesticides that paralyse insectsRead moreThey found that larger-bodied bees and comb-building cavity nesters declined in abundance as temperatures increased, while smaller, soil-nesting bees increased.“Our research suggests that climate-induced changes in temperature, snowpack and summer precipitation may drastically reshape bee communities,” the authors said.Researchers said the findings suggested a reduction of bigger bees, including in the families of bumblebee, leafcutters and mason bees, with higher temperatures.Declines were particularly marked for bumblebees, which the researchers said suggested “this group is more threatened under climate warming than other bees in our system”. That tallies with other studies showing that bumblebees, the dominant pollinators in many ecosystems, have a lower heat tolerance than other bees and move to cooler regions at higher altitudes as temperatures warm.Researchers said their findings suggested both bumblebees’ body size and nest behaviour could also make them more vulnerable in a warming world.More broadly, the authors said climate-driven changes to pollinator communities “could have cascading effects on pollination and ecosystem functioning”. For example, they said losing bigger bees, which tend to fly further for food, may mean a reduction in longer-distance pollination.The study was specifically focused on mountainous areas, but the researchers said other research across the US showed declines in larger bees in response to environmental changes.Insects are the world’s top pollinators: 75% of 115 top global food crops depend on animal pollination, including cocoa, coffee, almonds and cherries, according to the UN.In a landmark 2019 report, scientists concluded that nearly half of all insect species worldwide are in decline and a third could disappear altogether by century’s end. One in six species of bees have gone regionally extinct somewhere in the world.The main drivers of extinction are thought to be habitat loss and pesticide use.","**Climate Change and Bees**

8, UK energy industry urges ministers to stick with net zero plan,"Some rightwingers claim renewables have increased costs, but Energy UK blames over-reliance on gas","Energy companies want the government to implement policies to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions, the industry’s leader has said, despite claims from some on the political right that high energy prices should spark a rethink.Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive of Energy UK, which represents the industry, said: “The government should press on with net zero policies. That’s something they still need to do. We are missing the carbon budgets.”She called on ministers to “tighten energy efficiency”, by insulating more homes, and changing planning and construction rules, while developing a strategy for decarbonising the UK’s fleet of gas-fired power stations.She rejected claims that renewable energy had increased costs, saying the problem was clearly an over-reliance on gas, especially for heating. She told a meeting hosted by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit: “The UK is exposed to gas because we have a huge amount of gas burned in our homes, and so helping people get off gas boilers on to other forms of heating technology is critical over the next decades to reduce our reliance on places like Russia.”She added: “But [it’s also necessary] to make our building stock much more energy-efficient. The reason we have high rates of fuel poverty in the UK isn’t just about the commodity we burn, it’s the volume of it we burn because our energy efficiency rates here are much lower than other countries.”Britain’s leaky homes make the energy crisis worse. Why have governments not fixed them? | Max WakefieldRead moreHouseholds are facing an energy price cap rise this April, likely to amount to £2,000 for the average bill, and possibly a further rise to £2,400 in October. The cost-of-living crisis has embroiled the government in calls from its own backbenches to scale back or abandon measures to promote renewable energy and pay for home insulation for poor households, even though renewable energy is many times cheaper than gas and improving home insulation would cut bills for the most vulnerable.Bim Afolami, Conservative MP for Hitchin and Harpenden, called on his fellow Tories to get behind net zero policies, saying only “a very small number” of MPs were questioning them.“Let’s be clear, in terms of delivering net zero, there is no real option other than what the government has set out. It’s a shame that it needs saying, but everyone should rest assured that the bulk of the Conservative party and the government is four-square behind this, and committed to getting it done,” he said.Q&AWhat is net zero?ShowNet zero is the commitment to reducing emissions by 100% so that the UK is producing no more carbon than it removes from the atmosphere. This will have to be achieved by reducing the amount of greenhouse gases created by activities such as industrial processes, power generation, transport and intensive agriculture, while removing emissions at the same time by capturing carbon or planting more trees.It is considered the minimum necessary to stop dangerous climate breakdown increasing the world’s temperature by more than 1.5 degrees celsius. However, there is a debate about how to get there, and how quickly, and how the costs will be spread. The current UK government wants to meet net zero by 2050, which will necessarily involve replacing gas boilers, moving to electric cars, improving insulation and lowering high-carbon consumption such as flights and meat-eating.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Michael Grubb, professor of energy and climate change at University College London, said consumers were paying unnecessarily high prices for their electricity, as well as their gas, because of the way the UK energy market works. Electricity prices are set by the gas price, even though gas makes up only about 40% of electricity generation and renewable energy prices are far lower.He said the government could ease this by changing the way the UK energy market is structured, allowing for a “pool” of green energy contracts.Ministers should levy a windfall tax on fossil fuel producers, which have seen bumper profits from the global rise in gas prices and Russia’s constraint on European supplies, added Tessa Khan, founder of campaigning organisation Uplift. Taxes on fossil fuels in the UK were far too low, and tiny compared with those of other countries, at about $2 (£1.47) a barrel in the UK compared with more than $20 a barrel for Norway.Even at such low rates, thanks to favourable rules, some fossil fuels had received payouts from the government in recent years, rather than pay tax, she said. Oil and gas producers faced no extra costs but were reaping “windfall profits” from the gas price. “These profits are being privatised. The UK tax regime has made this the most profitable country in the world for oil and gas companies,” she said.","**Headline:** Support a cleaner future

9,The bear truth: why happy pandas can’t be bothered to find a partner,Researchers now think pandas’ notoriously low libido is because they are too comfortable to make the effort to search for a mate,"Name: Panda sex.Age: 18m years old.Frequency: Famously rare.Yes, why is that? If I were a panda, I’d be at it all the time. I think from this we can determine two things: first that you are a pervert, and second that you are unhappy.Hey, I’m not unhappy! Maybe you have more in common with pandas than you thought. Researchers have posited that the notoriously low panda libido might be down to simple contentment.How so? Well, a study published in Conservation Biology has suggested that if pandas find the perfect habitat – in this instance a cool, moderately low-lying area rich with bamboo and far from humans – then they will just happily settle down and not go anywhere.Who can blame them? That sounds perfect. Well, the worry is that by staying in the same area, they aren’t going out to search for food or mates, which reduces their genetic diversity, which will eventually lead to their extinction.So you’re saying that pandas prefer comfortable solitude to sex? Yes.And it’s possible to be so comfortable that you might take down your entire species? Yes.Am … am I a panda? If you are, I have to commend your ability to type so accurately with your great big paws.Do scientists want to make pandas less comfortable? To some extent, yes. The researchers have found that the ideal level of comfort to keep the pandas alive is 80%.Why 80%? Because then they are comfortable enough to thrive, but there’s still enough dissatisfaction to make them leave home, bump into a sexy panda stranger and get it on.Great! Job sorted. Well, that’s only step one. Even if two pandas were to clap eyes on each other and instantly fall in love, it doesn’t mean that we would hear the pitter patter of tiny paws any time soon. Remember the story of Tian Tian?Tian Tian? Yes, one of the UK’s only two giant pandas, leased to Edinburgh zoo a decade ago by the Bifengxia breeding centre in Sichuan, China. The lease runs out in December, and Tian Tian has failed to give birth.Why? Sometimes it just doesn’t happen. She had cubs in China, only to endure a number of failed pregnancies – some initiated by artificial insemination – in Edinburgh. Things went further downhill when her partner, Yang Guang, had his testicles removed, after a tumour was discovered.God, that’s sad. Is it? Or is she just so happy that she has rejected sex as a concept?There’s a moral here, isn’t there? Yes. It’s that it’s OK if personal contentment is more important to you than romantic love. And also that pandas are seemingly determined to make themselves extinct.Do say: “Happy pandas don’t have sex.”Don’t say: “Quick, someone invent Panda Instagram to make them all feel ugly and insecure.”","**Headline:** The Curious Case of the Lazy Panda

10, Shell chief vows to bolster emissions strategy after court ruling, Ben van Beurden pledges to ‘rise to challenge’ after court ordered oil firm to cut global carbon emissions by 45%,"Royal Dutch Shell has vowed to accelerate its strategy towards becoming a net zero emissions business, two weeks after a Dutch court ruling ordered the company to cut its global carbon emissions by 45% by the end of 2030 compared with 2019 levels.Shell’s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, promised to “rise to the challenge” in helping to create a low-carbon energy system, but came out fighting for the Anglo-Dutch oil company he runs, insisting it has been leading the industry in taking responsibility for its carbon emissions.In a statement on his LinkedIn page, Van Beurden said he was surprised by the court’s verdict and was “disappointed that Shell is being singled out by a ruling that I believe does not help reduce global CO2 emissions”.He added: “A court ordering one energy company to reduce its emissions – and the emissions of its customers – is not the answer.”The transition to low-carbon energy, which remained necessary to battle the climate emergency, was “far too big a challenge for one company to tackle”, he wrote, calling for clearer regulations and policies from global governments.It’s time to nationalize Shell. Private oil companies are no longer fit for purpose | Johanna Bozuwa and Olúfẹ́mi O TáíwòRead moreShell said it was reviewing the ruling handed down last month by a court in The Hague and expected to appeal. But the court has said its decision is immediately applicable and should not be suspended before an appeal.Shell’s oil production had probably peaked in 2019, Van Beurden said, adding that he believed the firm’s total absolute carbon emissions would decline from 2018 levels. Instead, he said Shell should work with its customers to help them find their own way to achieving net zero emissions.The oil firm said it would continue to produce oil and gas products “for a long time to come” in order to meet customer demand and retain the company’s financial strength, while also attracting investment.“Imagine Shell decided to stop selling petrol and diesel today. This would certainly cut Shell’s carbon emissions. But it would not help the world one bit,” Van Beurden wrote. “Demand for fuel would not change. People would fill up their cars and delivery trucks at other service stations.”The company said it had “rigorous, short-term reduction targets” on the way to its goal of becoming a net zero emissions business by 2050. The chief executive added that Shell had taken responsibility for reducing the carbon emissions it produced, as well as those produced when customers used its products.The landmark Dutch case was brought by the environmental group Friends of the Earth and more than 17,000 co-plaintiffs, who successfully argued that Shell had been aware of the dangerous consequences of CO2 emissions for decades, and that and its targets remained insufficiently robust.The company was told by the court that its emission reductions, along with those of its suppliers and buyers, should be brought into line with the Paris climate agreement.Although it intended to appeal against the ruling, Shell said it would “seek ways to reduce emissions even further in a way that remains purposeful and profitable”.As part of its energy transition strategy, Shell said it had in recent years invested “billions of dollars” in lower-carbon energy, including wind and solar power, hydrogen and biofuels.Shell has vowed to give investors a chance to vote on the progress of its transition strategy at every annual shareholder meeting. Van Beurden complained that the court hearing took place several months before the publication of the strategy.Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk Shell faced a significant investor rebellion at its most recent AGM, when a shareholder resolution coordinated by Follow This, a Dutch climate activist group, calling for the company to set binding carbon emissions targets received 30% of votes.Mark van Baal, the founder of Follow This, said Van Beurden had “failed to have his epiphany moment, and still thinks that committing to the Paris agreement is an unfair ask. More stakeholders than ever are pushing for Paris-alignment and there comes a time when Shell will have to listen and act. Butvan Beurden can take comfort that Shell is not alone in this challenge.”Rachel Kennerley, an international climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said Shell’s promises did not far enough.She added: “If Mr van Beurden was as serious about this as he claims, he’d stop dismissing his company’s role in driving this devastating situation and would use the court ruling as an intervention to do the right thing, rather than appealing it with all of Shell’s corporate might.”","**Headline:** Shell Commits to Reducing Emissions

11,Country Diary: Down on the floor with the solitary bees,"Holywell, Flintshire: In my attempts to make my garden more suitable for Mediterranean herbs, I created the conditions for these fascinating insects","I’m lying on my front on the moist, mossy lawn, the sun warming my back. Around me swallows are swooping in and out of the barn while dandelions, lady’s smock and cowslips attract the butterflies and bees. But down here, my attention is focused under the box hedges of my herb garden. I am watching volcanoes form. Not the sort that spew hot lava, but small cones of the gritty soil with a vent in the top about the size of my little fingernail.A tawny mining bee: ‘The 240 species of solitary bees in Britain … are just as important for pollination as the one species of honeybee.’ Photograph: Jan MillerThese are the entrances to the breeding burrows of the tawny mining bee, Andrena fulva. They are just one of the 240 species of solitary bees in Britain, and are just as important for pollination as the one species of honeybee. Each has different shaped mouthparts, which have evolved alongside flowers with different access routes to their nectar so that the plants are more likely to be pollinated from the same species. And you don’t have to farm the solitaries. This type needs only fine, sandy soil so they can dig deep burrows (and surprisingly quickly too with their tiny legs). They make side chambers and lay one egg in each, with a small supply of nectar and pollen. Then they’re sealed up and the larvae left to hibernate over winter, until they dig their way out the next spring.I could never grow Mediterranean herbs such as thyme, sage, oregano, orpine or lavender in my damp garden until a few years ago, when I had this square dug out and filled with limestone hardcore. Unwittingly, I had also made the perfect place for these mining bees to breed. It also helped that this was under the bit of lawn where we once had the kids’ sandpit.Meanwhile, the osmia mining bees – the red mason and the leafcutter bees you can buy nesting houses for in garden shops – are a different species. I was puzzled to see an osmia scrabbling against the mud-sealed doors once, as I thought it couldn’t be a predator of its own kind. A quick post on the Facebook page of the specialist Bees, Wasps and Ants Recording Society got me an answer in 10 minutes – it was the male who could “smell” the virgin female inside and was desperate to mate with her before any other.

12,"Monday briefing: The dramatic, agonising, crucial talks that will decide Cop27’s success","In today’s newsletter: For the next two weeks, ministers, negotiators from countries large and small will gather in Egypt. Can they get anything done?","Good morning. Last year, the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow kept alive the target of holding global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels; but, conference president Alok Sharma said, “its pulse is weak”. The vital question for the Cop27 summit at Sharm-el-Sheikh in Egypt, which began yesterday, is whether it will prove to be an emergency room or a hospice.If Cop27 is to have any chance of renewing global commitments after a year of extremely limited progress, the work of the negotiators who will take over once world leaders have departed at the end of today will be crucial. I spoke to the Guardian’s environment correspondent Fiona Harvey about the fascinating, byzantine, surprisingly dramatic and extremely nerdy process of climate diplomacy – and why, as deeply frustrating as it might be, it matters so much.That’s after the headlines. And a quick note to say that I’m off the rest of this week – Nimo and recurring guest star Dan Milmo will be in your inbox.Five big stories
Economy | Jeremy Hunt will announce £25bn worth of tax rises and £35bn in spending cuts at the autumn statement, the Guardian understands. The scale of the measures has grown significantly after the Bank of England’s dire forecasts last week of the longest recession since the 1930s.
Ukraine | The Biden administration has reportedly warned Kyiv that allies’ “Ukraine fatigue” could worsen if Volodymyr Zelenskiy continues to be closed to negotiations with Russia.
Climate crisis | An assessment by Carbon Brief has found the US, UK and Canada have fallen billions of dollars short of their “fair share” of climate funding for low-income countries. This comes after the UN’s World Meteorological Organization said the past eight years were the eight hottest ever recorded, putting the internationally agreed 1.5C limit for global heating “barely within reach”.
Politics | Rishi Sunak is facing further questions over his political judgment after it emerged he was made aware of a complaint against his political ally Gavin Williamson before appointing him. Sunak was said to have been unaware of the contents of hostlile texts sent to former chief whip Wendy Morton.
Housing | More than 138,000 properties in England and Wales are owned by offshore companies. In London the offshore holdings are worth as much as £55bn.
In depth: ‘It’s awful and frustrating – but you can’t solve the climate crisis without Cop’A worker prepares the entrance to the “Green Zone” ahead of Cop27. Photograph: Thomas Hartwell/APThere are “periods of intense activity and huge longueurs” at climate summits, says Fiona Harvey in Sharm-el-Sheikh; happily, I reach her during one of the longueurs.She emphasises that this is not a “decision summit” like Glasgow. Instead, the focus will be on holding countries accountable for their commitments last year against the backdrop of the global energy crisis brought about by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In this piece from May, UN climate adviser Rachel Kyte describes the task as “implementation, implementation, implementation”.“We won’t get an agreement or a new treaty at the end of it,” Fiona said. “But it’s incredibly important we see progress.” This piece explains why it’s looking so tough, while this one sets out the vital importance of “loss and damage” financing for developing nations – which was finally confirmed as part of the agenda for the talks after “fractious” discussions that dragged late into the night and delayed the opening of the conference proper.In the Guardian’s Down to Earth newsletter (sign up here for twice-weekly updates throughout Cop27), Fiona writes: “This year’s Cop will be arguably the hardest yet.” The only path to success is through the endless minutiae of negotiation – “a lot of horrible absurdity”, Fiona said. “People arguing in rooms for hours.” Here’s how it works.What is the framework for the summit?“The first two days are about world leaders being there and having their photos taken and talking,” Fiona said. “After that, the negotiators get on with it. In the second week, next Tuesday, we get the ‘high-level segment’ – that’s when ministers join the talks.”All Cop summits take place under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, a treaty agreed almost 30 years ago. Everything that happens in Sharm-el-Sheikh – “the fact of the meeting, setting the agenda, the texts agreed at the end of it” – is a product of the UNFCCC.“It was a massive achievement,” Fiona said. “It is full of frustrations, but you can’t redraw it now – you just wouldn’t get people to sign up to it. The important thing is that it means that once things are agreed, countries have a legal obligation to see them through.”Who are the negotiators?Countries are represented individually, but blocs of nations with common interests – like the Africa Group, the Least Developed Countries, and the Small Island Developing States – seek to increase their negotiating power by clubbing together.“The big countries have teams of negotiators who do nothing all year round but these talks,” Fiona said. “They will have someone in every workstream, in every room. The poorer ones can’t do that – they will send one country to one event, another to another, and compare notes.”For a sense of what it’s like negotiating on behalf of those most vulnerable to the impact of the climate crisis, see this riveting fly-on-the-wall account of the work of Giza Gaspar-Martins, chair of the Least Developed Countries group at the Paris summit in 2015. He dashes from meeting to meeting across the impractically vast site, pausing only to “talk to my wife” (smoke a cigarette) and “do the things I cannot delegate” (go to the loo).What do they negotiate over?“It’s hilarious on one level, awful on another,” Fiona said. “It just sounds incomprehensible to anyone outside of this bizarre bubble. There are non-papers, ‘informal informals’, acres of square brackets, rows about the placements of semicolons. They sit for hours hammering it all out.”But these arcane points really matter. As Giza Gaspar-Martins says of a draft of the final Paris agreement: “We need to do some detective work. Some good brains have been working hard to hide things in here.”Also in Paris, a last-minute row over whether a “shall” ought to have been a “should” was only resolved with the dubious claim that a “typographical error” had been made, allowing the US to overlook a stronger commitment than it wanted on mitigation efforts in the final text. (Here’s a terrific account of that drama by the Guardian’s then-environment editor John Vidal.)In Glasgow, Alok Sharma fought back tears as he apologised to delegates over a late change, forced by China and India, changed a commitment to “phase out” coal to the looser promise to “phase down” its use. “Did I appreciate we had to adjust one thing tonight in a very unusual way?” John Kerry said afterwards. “No. But if we hadn’t done that, we wouldn’t have a deal.”How do these agreements get reached?The country holding the presidency – Egypt this year – will assign countries responsibility for managing negotiations over particular areas. “There’s an ‘ad hoc working group’ for every key part of the process that will meet in their own little rooms,” Fiona said. “So the Cop president will say on climate finance, for example, let’s have one developed and one developing country go away and convene other countries for talks.”Also helpful, Fiona added, is the way the summit allows for accidental interactions of key players. “This is the only forum which puts the developing countries on a somewhat level playing field,” she said. “They can catch a minister from an EU nation in a corridor, and say, with moral authority, ‘come on, mate’. That’s important.”None of this is very glamorous. Pictures abound from previous Cops of windowless shoeboxes with uncomfortable looking chairs shoehorned around a table covered in cold pizza and heavily annotated drafts. But it’s necessary work ahead of the final stage of discussions in the plenary session, which all countries attend.How does the text get finally agreed?One criticism of the consensus model of the Cop summits – which sees the text agreed in a final session involving every country – is that it enforces the “will of the laggards”: the argument is that is easy for countries that are reluctant to adopt crucial climate change measures to put a spanner in the works.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Saudi Arabia and Russia are happy to be the people in closed rooms making criticisms, but they don’t want to put themselves out there like that. So the process of consensus can force the laggards to catch up, and it outs those who won’t agree.”She points to the example of Durban 2011, where the treaty that became the Paris agreement was born. “Everyone was on board except China and India, and the EU forced a showdown – the talks went on for days, and in the end the EU called out China and India, and said, are you going to stand up? And they didn’t.”Does all of this add up to a process that meets the vast crisis already under way? Hardly. “You sit there and you talk about five-year review processes – we haven’t got five bloody years,” Fiona said. “But while Cop won’t solve the climate crisis, you can’t solve the climate crisis without Cop. It’s awful and inadequate and frustrating, but it’s still essential. These discussions are incredibly important because they’re the only discussions we’ve got.”What else we’ve been reading

13,  Egg prices could rise for UK consumers as farmers cut flock numbers,Fewer laying birds are being placed on farms as producers respond to poor retail profit margins,"Consumers could be hit with higher egg prices as UK farmers reduce their flock numbers, in response to escalating costs and insufficient profit margins.The numbers of chicks being placed by egg producers in April was down 15% year on year, according to the latest government  figures.Egg farmers have been warning for months that a “tidal wave” of rising costs in feed, energy, labour and packaging was not being reflected in retail prices.They have criticised supermarkets for ignoring industry warnings, with a leading producer telling delegates at the British Pig and Poultry Fair last week he expected a shortage of eggs later this year given the cuts in chick placings.The government data, published on Thursday, confirms a decline in producers restocking their flocks with new birds. The number of eggs being set by hatcheries fell even further in April, down 35% on the previous year.The number of chicks being placed by egg producers indicates the number of eggs that will be available to consumers in the months ahead.Hen eggs take about 21 days to hatch, but chicks do not start laying until they are aged about 20 weeks. Any reduction in chicks now will not affect the availability of eggs until the autumn.The existing hens on farms will continue producing eggs until they are 70 to 80 weeks old, but the overall flock population will fall as hens are not replaced.Free-range eggs unavailable in Britain from MondayRead more“It’s showing what we were predicting, that there will be a shortage unless retailers respond by raising prices,” said Robert Gooch, chief executive of the British FreeRange Egg Producers Association.Gooch says producers need a 3p per egg price increase to forestall a much bigger price rise when supplies fall later this year. Retail egg prices in May were up by about 8%, or 15p, per half dozen from last year, according to Trolley.co.uk, a supermarket price tracker.“If you were making money you wouldn’t do it [not restock]. You only do it because you can’t make a profit. It’s a crisis for producers and it will translate into a crisis for consumers later this year,” said Gooch.Andrew Opie, from the British Retail Consortium, said supermarkets sourced most of their food from the UK and “know they need to pay a sustainable price to farmers to ensure British eggs remain on the shelves”.A spokesperson for the British Egg Industry Council said chick placements did historically rise and fall depending on factors such as how long producers decide to keep their existing hens before replacing them. “However, with the current cost crisis, some producers are choosing not to repopulate their houses.” A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “We recognise the challenges faced by the egg industry, including the ongoing impact of Avian Influenza and increased input costs – and are continuing to monitor the situation, working closely with stakeholders.” Sign up for the Animals Farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the biggest farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

14," Here in British Columbia, we have spent the summer running from cruel wildfires Mary Stockdale",Blazes are destroying whole communities. The Canadian government must act now to tackle this existential threat,"Small fires crackle into life on the hills around us at the slightest provocation. Creeks swell with flash floods, as upland snow melts at record speed. Our town’s beloved colony of great blue herons fall stunned out of the trees in their dozens. Animals, from cougars to rattlesnakes, leave their hidden places to seek water. The temperature has risen, and stalled, at a nearly unbearable 45C.This is what a heat dome feels like in Vernon, a community in the British Columbian interior in Canada.It’s been quite the summer in British Columbia (BC), where a brutal heatwave has given way to wildfires. At 49.6C, the village of Lytton set a hotter record than there’s ever been in Las Vegas. The fires have burned nearly 8,582 sq km of forest since the spring and caused evacuation orders to be issued across the province. Lytton and another nearby community, Monte Lake, have been destroyed by the vengeful climate.Our fire, here in Vernon, announced itself with a wave of thick smoke and a glowing red horizon that made us think of JRR Tolkien’s Mordor. At midnight, an evacuation order was issued for the west side of the Okanagan Lake, where members of the Okanagan Indian Band live among enclaves of retirees, ranchers and back-to-the-landers. Soon after, two exhausted evacuees arrived at our door with their dogs, cats and belongings; they are friends of ours, to whom we had promised refuge.As the fire grew across the lake over the next few days, we found ourselves talking with hushed voices. Unable to ignore the red glare on the horizon, we felt awestruck by the ash floating from the sky, covering our decks, outdoor tables and car windshields. We shared photos of the piles of burnt forest debris, mainly small black twigs and needles, that had washed ashore on the lake’s beaches. We spoke obsessively of the air quality index, which I estimated had reached 45 times the World Health Organization exposure recommendation, ranking it as one of the worst on the planet.Mary Stockdale’s son, pictured far right, with other firefighters near Vernon, British Columbia. Photograph: Justin RobertsonSometimes it was not ash, but still-glowing embers that floated over to our side of the lake. Although the water provided a natural barrier to the front of the fire, it was being breached by these small missiles, and all of us had to look lively for any fires that started up under these tinder-dry conditions.As the situation worsened, an evacuation alert for Vernon was announced, stirring us all into action. My husband and I started packing. What do we need to live on? What don’t we want to lose to the fire? My mother was trying to do the same next door, but she was hampered by my bewildered father who has dementia. My daughter ran over to help.Eventually, we assembled a convoy of vehicles, packed to the brim and ready to move our three-generation family, our twice-evacuated friends and our assortment of pets. We worried about what it would be like if the people of greater Vernon got the order to evacuate, and all 66,000 of us tried to move out at once.Later that day, the cultural centre across the street decided to go ahead with its live outdoor concert. Like passengers on the Titanic, we sat on our ashy front steps and listened to the music. To our delight, the first rainstorm in weeks blew in to rescue us, and we jumped up to dance in the raindrops, accompanied by the happy whoops of the musicians over the loudspeakers.As a result of the rain, the evacuation alert was rescinded, at least for most of Vernon. However, the west side remained evacuated, with dozens of homes burned to the ground. I joined many other community members in volunteering to help with the registration of several thousand evacuees and their referral to emergency services.It’s good that the BC government looks after people’s basic needs: shelter, food, clothing, incidentals, but this doesn’t alleviate their misery. These were emotionally exhausted people: an elderly woman who longed for her home and garden; a man who had put his back out with the effort of moving house; a family who, in rescuing their grandmother with her oxygen tank, were forced to jettison most of their belongings. Saddest of all was a young family who broke down telling us about the mother dog with puppies that they had to abandon to the flames when fleeing the fire.In the cadet barracks on the south side of town, 250 soldiers were brought in to help us, and a camp was set up on the north side for 330 firefighters. A small group of locals have gathered at a spot on the highway to cheer them home each evening.How can Britain be committed to net zero when it’s about to drill for millions more barrels of oil? | Greg MuttittRead moreMy son, a 21-year-old firefighter, called. Since he was new to this, we had hoped they would put him to work digging ditches, but he was sent straight to the front, where he said it was like a war zone: helicopters buzzing, smoke thick, trees suddenly candling.My brother called. A fire researcher, he’s been making predictive models from satellite imagery for the firefighters. He was feeling anxious for us, as he could see that a second heatwave was on its way, to be followed by gusting winds that might stir up our fire again.Once again, we have been thrust into a period of uncertainty. What will happen to us and to other endangered communities to the north and east of our fire?A federal election has just been called in Canada. We desperately hope our region’s voters, given all that we have gone through, will send a strong protest vote to Ottawa, saying they must take the climate crisis seriously. The land around us is burning, the air is unbreathable, people in our community have become climate refugees. This is an existential threat. If not now, when?

15, This article is more than 5 months oldSunak’s plan for carbon capture is good news: he shouldn’t muddy it with party politicsThis article is more than 5 months oldSimon Jenkins,Consensus on tackling the climate crisis is what’s needed now – and direct action against CO2 must be the next move,"For as long as the United Kingdom needs to use oil and gas, we should be making an effort to capture any resulting CO2 and store it. That clearly makes sense. It also makes sense to produce our own oil and gas, so we are less beholden to exporters (though of course ours, too, would be sold on the international markets).So far, so good for Rishi Sunak’s twofold announcement today in Scotland. But it would be helpful if he did not muddy these waters by using them to score political points against Labour in the run-up to an election campaign. What we desperately need now, as we confront the climate crisis, is agreement on a way forward. Bringing party politics into it will only hinder progress.Of course, critics are right to say that where we buy our energy should not deflect attention from the urgent need to reduce demand for fossil fuels. But that issue is one of constraining overall demand, not arguing over the source of supply. Preferring to use only ship-borne oil to avoid the supposed taint of dirtying our hands in the North Sea would be hypocrisy.Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a separate issue. Like power from nuclear fusion, it is one of those solutions to the climate crisis that has always been just over the horizon. But as academics such as Oxford’s Myles Allen and Edinburgh’s Stuart Haszeldine have long argued, unlike fusion, the issue is not one of science and technology. It is one of politics and money. Norway’s carbon capture operations in the North Sea have been running since 1996, and now store close to a million tonnes of CO2 every year. Denmark’s first full-scale carbon capture and storage project was launched this summer, also in the North Sea. There is nothing new in Sunak’s project other than it is British.Rishi Sunak says approving new licences for oil and gas drilling ‘entirely consistent’ with net zero plan – UK politics liveRead moreThis issue now is one of politics. Existing CCS currently reduces CO2 emissions by 0.1%. To meet net zero, it needs to rise to 10%. This requires a massive uplift of investment. At present, Sunak’s commitment to the current Acorn project appears to be minimal, particularly in comparison to the reportedly “unachievable” and energy-guzzling HS2. But CCS has one advantage: that it could be largely financed through the marketplace by imposing the cost not on taxpayers, but on polluters direct. According to Haszeldine, all emitters of CO2 should themselves fund the capture and storage of one tonne of the gas for every tonne they emit. He estimates this would add probably 15p a litre to the price of petrol. Everyone – producers and consumers – would play their part.It is known in the energy world that the big corporations are waiting to be ordered to embark on CCS by a government with the guts to do it. That is perhaps why they have been building up cash reserves to obscene levels. It has to be right that those who produce pollutants should also dispose of them. There is no pretending that this will be cheap. But efforts to reduce global emissions piecemeal are reportedly failing even to approach net zero. There are clearly limits to how far the rich world will transform its lifestyle. The next great battle has to be direct action against CO2. That this would cost money can hardly be an objection: this is a crisis, after all.

16," This article is more than 11 months oldFood, feed and fuel: global seaweed industry could reduce land needed for farming by 110m hectares, study findsThis article is more than 11 months old",Scientists identify parts of ocean suitable for seaweed cultivation and suggest it could constitute 10% of human diet to reduce impact of agriculture,"An area of ocean almost the size of Australia could support commercial seaweed farming around the world, providing food for humans, feed supplements for cattle, and alternative fuels, according to new research.Seaweed farming is a nascent industry globally but the research says if it could grow to constitute 10% of human diets by 2050 it could reduce the amount of land needed for food by 110m hectares (272m acres) – an area twice the size of France.But the authors of the research said there are a range of potential negative impacts on marine life that will need to be balanced with the benefits of a global seaweed farming industry.The study looked at 34 seaweed species and where they could feasibly grow and then narrowed this down to places with calm enough waters and close enough to populations where farms could be established.Have we reached ‘peak meat’? Why one country is trying to limit its number of livestockRead moreAbout 650m hectares (1,606m acres) was identified as plausible for seaweed farming, with the largest areas in Indonesia and Australia which both have large ocean regions under their economic control.“Cultivating seaweeds for food, feed and fuel within even a fraction of the 650m hectares of suitable ocean could have profound benefits to land use, emissions reduction, water and fertiliser use,” the authors wrote.Scott Spillias, a researcher at the University of Queensland in Australia who led the study published in Nature Sustainability, said: “People around the world are looking at the ocean as this big ‘untapped’ resource and asking if we should be using more of it.”One of the biggest benefits, the study said, would be the cultivation and use of red Asparagopsis as a cattle feed supplement that has been shown to result in drastically lower methane emissions from cows. One supplement based on the seaweed reportedly went on commercial sale to farmers in Australia last year.The study suggested cuts to methane emissions from using Asparagopsis could save 2.6bn tonnes of CO2-equivalent a year by 2050 – about the same as the current greenhouse gas footprint of India.Spillias said introducing more seaweed into human diets could also deliver benefits. In parts of Asia, seaweed makes up 2% of diets, but scaling this up to 10% globally could spare 110m hectares of land currently used for growing food.“Basically this is just people eating more vegetables,” he said. “If we grow seaweed, the best thing to do is for people to eat it rather than feed it to livestock, but that’s going to need some big cultural shifts.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If this is done on a large scale we need to find better materials.”He said if there was a widescale push globally for seaweed farming, there could be social implications.“Marine industries do not have a great reputation on human rights and if we’re farming seaweed largely out of sight, then we need to think of the people in these industries and make sure they’re being fairly treated,” he said.","**Headline:** Embrace the Future of Sustainability

17," This article is more than 4 months oldUS behind more than a third of global oil and gas expansion plans, report findsThis article is more than 4 months old",Study highlights conflict between Washington’s claims of climate leadership and its fossil fuel growth plans,"The US accounts for more than a third of the expansion of global oil and gas production planned by mid-century, despite its claims of climate leadership, research has found.Canada and Russia have the next biggest expansion plans, calculated based on how much carbon dioxide is likely to be produced from new developments, followed by Iran, China and Brazil. The United Arab Emirates, which is to host the annual UN climate summit this year, Cop28 in Dubai in November, is seventh on the list.The data, in a report from the campaign group Oil Change International, also showed that five “global north countries” – the US, Canada, Australia, Norway and the UK – will be responsible for just over half of all the planned expansion from new oil and gas fields to 2050.Greenhouse gas emissions from all of the oil and gas expansion that is planned in the next three decades would be more than enough to drive global temperatures well beyond the limit of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels that countries agreed in 2021 at Cop26 in Glasgow, the report found.The International Energy Agency warned in 2021 that no new oil and gas exploration and development could take place if the world was to stay within the 1.5C limit. But only a handful of countries with oil and gas reserves are forswearing new exploration and drilling.Romain Ioualalen, the global policy lead at Oil Change International and co-author of the report, said countries must call a halt to fossil fuel expansion. “It’s simple: when you are in a hole, the first step is to stop digging,” he said. “The climate crisis is global in nature, but is atrociously unjust. A handful of the world’s richest nations are risking our future by willingly ignoring the calls to rapidly phase out fossil fuels.”The report, titled Planet wreckers: how 20 countries’ oil and gas extraction plans risk locking in climate chaos, published on Tuesday, found that 20 countries were responsible for plans for new oil and gas developments by 2050 that would add about 173bn tonnes of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. That amount is the same as the lifetime emissions of 1,100 coal-fired power plants, or more than 30 years of the US’s annual emissions.By contrast, if countries were to forego bringing new oil and gas fields into production, the decline of existing fields would mean global oil and gas production would slow by about 2% a year from now to 2030, and 5% a year from 2030 to 2050.The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has stepped up calls for countries to get out of fossil fuels, warning of “moral and economic madness”, and has said fossil fuel interests have “humanity by the throat”. He will convene a conference of world leaders later this month in New York to try to elicit fresh commitments to tackle the climate crisis.He has told world leaders they will be allowed to participate in the summit, on the sidelines of the annual UN general assembly, only if they can show that they have clear implementation plans to cut their greenhouse gas emissions.The Guardian revealed at the weekend that Rishi Sunak, the UK prime minister, had been warned of the UN’s strict policy on whether leaders could participate before he took the highly unusual decision not to attend the UN general assembly.Sunak promised over the summer to “max out” the UK’s oil and gas operations in the North Sea, with scores of potential new licences.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We know we cannot keep opening up new oil and gas fields if we want a habitable world, yet that is exactly what this government is doing.”She added: “Rishi Sunak needs to stop bowing to the demands of the fossil fuel companies, who continue to rake in obscene profits while millions of us cannot afford to heat our homes.”A spokesperson for the UK’s Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: “This report ignores the great strides we have taken in reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. Between 1990 and 2021, we cut emissions by 48% while growing our economy by 65% – decarbonising faster than any other G7 country.“Even in 2050, when we have reached net zero, it is estimated the UK may still be using a quarter of the gas we do now and, as well as strengthening our energy security, independent research has shown domestically produced gas is on average four times cleaner than imports.”",**Headline:** Alarming Climate Crisis: **Body:** Global oil and gas expansion plans threaten our future.

18,"The Guardian view on switching off: in an always-on culture, we need time to thinkEditorial",Midwinter is for hibernation and the chance to make different kinds of connections,"“Disconnect from the internet for at least two hours a day and treat your own thoughts like a garden through which you are strolling,” was the advice offered by the novelist Ian McEwan to younger writers after being made a Companion of Honour in December. The capacity to be curious about mental processes – while simultaneously experiencing them – is an important one for an author seeking to describe the human condition. But anyone who values self-awareness will be used to noticing how their mind works and wondering why.“Only connect” was the maxim of another famous novelist, EM Forster. Forster used the characters in his novels to put flesh on his arguments against the emotionally repressive code of the time. But McEwan’s recommendation to disconnect should not be understood as a repudiation of Forster’s humanism. He was not warning writers off paying attention to other people’s minds and ideas – but drawing attention to the need to spend time with our own. In a world of permanent connection, in which attention has been commodified, switching off and away from the outside world is arguably harder than ever before.Many of us are so attached to our phones and other devices that even a temporary separation provokes anxiety (though less so for those whose jobs are not screen-based, and whose communications are arguably better balanced as a result). The Guardian’s new series Reclaim Your Brain is a response to the growing frustration that many feel at the hold that smartphones have on our minds and happiness, and explores ways of resetting that relationship.But tuning out, whether for two hours or two weeks, is not only about defying the masters of the digital universe – or turning back the clock to a time before news was 24/7 and phones were video cameras. What is turned towards also counts. The long evenings of January, with a new year stretching ahead of us, can be a good time for introspection as well as the self-improvement that traditionally takes the form of resolutions such as diets and exercise plans.John Keats set out his theory of “negative capability” in a letter written in the middle of winter, after an evening walk with a friend. We cannot say whether the shortness of the day inspired the direction that the poet’s thoughts took that evening in 1817. But the state of not knowing that Keats believed artists should aspire to – the ability to be “in uncertainties, Mysteries and doubts without any irritable reaching after fact or reason” – seems more fitted to gloomy candlelight than blazing sunshine.Doing nothing can be boring. Being alone can be miserable. Far too many people in the UK this winter are experiencing severe material or social deprivation. To those whose lives are otherwise full – of activities, appointments, responsibilities, pleasures – a few weeks’ hibernation may be welcome. For many others, it is a more stimulating life, rather than a quieter, more secluded one, that is desired.But for others, this time of year is valuable for the sense of slowing down it brings; the chance to take stock either on one’s own or through talking with others. Looking ahead is one aspect of this. Another is looking back and inward; or not looking at all, but being in the moment with our hopes, mysteries and doubts.","**Headline:** Reclaim Your Brain

19, Britain arrives at Cop27 in disarray over the climate – and the world’s leaders know itLucy Sherriff,"After Johnson’s weak energy plan and Truss’s scepticism, we have Rishi Sunak, who didn’t even want to attend","“Unless we take urgent action, we will get 3C hotter,” Boris Johnson told the UN climate talks in 2020. “As a country … we must now act.” The former prime minister’s words were a rallying cry to galvanise the government into taking action on global heating.Johnson’s administration had been under heavy fire for its lacklustre approach to the climate crisis. But fast forward a year to Cop26, and not much had changed. Johnson’s appearance was criticised as much as his policies; he was described as “a clown” after comparing the climate emergency to James Bond wrestling with a ticking bomb. His comments were in keeping with the travelling circus act that he has been performing ever since he first entered politics – even the future of the world was a joke.The government’s target of net zero emissions by 2050 and its plan to phase out petrol-powered vehicles by 2035 were certainly a steer in the right direction. But Johnson’s pledges – and his words – proved meaningless.Long before he was ousted as Conservative leader, his energy security strategy fell flat; originally promised for March this year, it was delayed by weeks. The final product failed to deliver on the government’s original promises to confront rocketing energy bills and transition away from fossil fuels. Instead, Johnson promised investment in offshore windfarms and new nuclear plants, the benefits of which won’t be felt for years.In September, the UK missed its deadline to pay nearly $300m to the developing countries hit hardest by the climate crisis, from Honduras to Afghanistan to Ethiopia. The money was pledged at Cop26, where poorer nations, gripped by floods, droughts and rising sea levels, had called for $100bn of financial aid. The global south has been plagued by climate-induced disasters, the likes of which the western world has yet to experience. India, for example, has witnessed a climate-induced disaster almost every day so far this year.00:04:00Cop27: the climate carnage we've faced this year – videoBut it is these beleaguered countries that have been urged to halt their industrial development and switch to greener means in order to curb climate change, despite western powers’ prolific use of fossil fuels. After years of lecturing India, China, Indonesia and other members of the developing world about coal dependence, the UK – and Europe – is now turning to coal-powered generation to see it through the impending energy crisis caused by the Ukraine-Russia war. A blistering, shameful irony that only betrays how ill-prepared we really are for a clean energy future. And to add insult to injury, the government recently offered new licences to drill in the North Sea.The UK’s dire lack of action on the impending climate catastrophe has been compounded by a revolving door of prime ministers. Many breathed a sigh of relief when Liz Truss – who expressed scepticism about the ambitious action needed to meet net zero goals, wanted to suspend green levies and moved to overturn a ban on fracking, among various other climate faux pas – handed in her notice.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But Rishi Sunak’s initial decision not to attend this year’s talks because he was too focused on the domestic economy exposed exactly where the new government’s priorities lie. An insular approach to climate change is absolutely the wrong one. Turning inwards and focusing on self-interests is what got us here in the first place.Sadly, Sunak’s U-turn comes too late. We have already glimpsed behind the veil, along with the rest of the world. “It seems as if they are washing their hands of leadership,” remarked Belize’s ambassador to the UN, Carlos Fuller.The world will not forget the prime minister so publicly prioritising his home turf over the world’s most pressing issues. What the UK needs – what the world needs – is to turn ambition into action, and to pursue a global approach to tackling the crisis.It is now abundantly clear that we are not going to meet the 1.5C target for global heating agreed by western leaders with such conviction at the historic Paris climate talks in 2015. And, as David Attenborough said during his Cop26 speech, we have now reached a stage of “desperate hope”.

","Taronga and Melbourne zoos have introduced measures to protect their animals from the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak that is threatening Australia.Although there have been no domestic cases reported yet, both zoos have implemented added biosecurity restrictions as precautionary measures amid the outbreak in Indonesia.The Taronga Conservation Society Australia, which runs Taronga Zoo and the Western Plains Zoo in Dubbo, said they have stopped allowing visitors to walk through the enclosures of animals which are at higher risk of exposure and visitors are wearing footwear covers in some areas.They said they are also reviewing their FMD plan to ensure it is aligned with the plan established by Ausvet, the national body for animal epidemiologists.“Across our two zoos Taronga has enacted stricter measures including the cessation of animal walkthroughs with animals at higher risk such as the deer and goat walkthroughs at Taronga Western Plains Zoo,” the Taronga Conservation Society said in a statement.“The wearing of footwear covers in some animal encounters will also be implemented. We are currently in the process of communicating this with our community.”Zoos Victoria said the risk of transmission to their animals was extremely low, but in an email to members they announced a series of protocol changes.People who have recently visited Indonesia are being asked to wait 48 hours before visiting the zoo, while those who live with any livestock – except horses – have been requested to avoid visiting altogether.

A public pathway along a trail used by critically endangered Asian elephants to walk between paddocks has been blocked off to ensure the animals are not stepping in soil that could have been brought in from outside the zoo.Additionally, visitor encounters with giraffes, kangaroos, and elephants are temporarily unavailable.Foot-and-mouth disease: ‘biosecurity response zones’ set up at airports in Australian firstRead more“We have put in place some containment protocols to help ensure our animals are safe and that this risk remains low,” the email to zoo members said.Zoos Victoria said staff are also taking precautions to ensure animals are protected, and will be following the Department of Agriculture and Chief Veterinary Officer’s advice in the event of an outbreak.The federal opposition has intensified its calls to shut the border with Indonesia, but agriculture minister Murray Watt said such a move would damage Australia’s agricultural reputation, especially as evidence suggests existing biosecurity measures are doing their job.On Monday, opposition leader Peter Dutton said the government was “playing with a loaded gun”, suggesting that if the virus were to reach Australia, hundreds of thousands of livestock would be slaughtered, forcing the price of meat “through the roof.”There have been no detections of the live virus in Australia, but viral fragments have been detected. Biosecurity response zones were set up Australian airports last week.The government has also ordered the checking of parcels arriving from China and Indonesia as part of the response to the virus.While the disease is not dangerous to humans, if an outbreak were to occur, a 72-hour stand still for all livestock movements in Australia would have to be implemented, amid a significant biosecurity containment response.","**Headline:** Protect Our Animals from Foot-and-Mouth Disease

21,Are debt-for-nature swaps the way forward for conservation?,Agreements to reduce developing countries’ debt burden in exchange for spending on nature will be on the agenda at a finance summit in Paris this week,"After decades in the wilderness, and familiar to only those in the know, “debt-for-nature swaps” are becoming one of the hottest things in conservation finance. Last month, Ecuador struck the biggest deal of its kind: refinancing $1.6bn (£1.3bn) of its commercial debt at a discount in exchange for a consistent revenue stream for conservation around the Galápagos Islands.Other nature-rich countries that are struggling to pay their debts have taken notice and deals are rumoured in Gabon and Sri Lanka. The market for debt-for-nature swaps is poised to exceed $800bn, according to Bloomberg, prompting fierce competition between banks as demand for green investments increases.The ‘father of biodiversity’ Dr Thomas Lovejoy, in 2005. He had the original idea behind debt-for-nature swaps. Photograph: Dallas Kilponen/SMH/Getty ImagesDebt-for-nature swaps mean reducing a developing country’s debt burden in exchange for guaranteed finance for nature. Supporters of the concept – which has its roots in the 1980s debt crisis and an idea from the late “father of biodiversity”, Thomas Lovejoy – say it is a win-win for financiers, countries and conservationists.This week, the subject will be on the agenda at the Summit for a New Global Financing Pact in Paris, spearheaded by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the prime minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley. Barbados entered into its own $150m debt-for-nature deal in 2021.“The world is facing a biodiversity, climate and debt crisis, which is even more pronounced in the developing world,” says Slav Gatchev, managing director of sustainable debt for the Nature Conservancy (TNC), which is often involved in facilitating deals.“There is an overlap between biodiversity hotspots in the tropics and excessive levels of debt,” he says. “Typically, countries approach us because they’ve seen that these deals can be done at scale.As debtor nations cut back on government spending, programmes for protecting natural resources are among the first to goThomas Lovejoy“You can move the needle in terms of financial pinch points, resolving liquidity constraints before they become solvency problems and, because of our role as a conservation organisation, we can be an honest broker when it comes to implementing these programmes on the ground.”But detractors of the deals warn of greenwashing, and have criticised agreements in which banks often take large fees with comparatively small amounts going to conservation.In a note to investors in January, Barclays questioned the green credentials of debt-for-nature swaps – often sold as ESG (environmental, social and governance) investments – because only a small fraction of the deal size ends up with conservation. This claim is strongly disputed by the banks involved.Separately, Daniel Ortega Pacheco, a former Ecuadorian environment minister, is concerned about the potential implications of the agreements for sovereignty. Last month’s Galápagos agreement requires Ecuador to provide about $18m a year to conserve waters near the islands, mostly for a new Hermandad marine reserve that hosts whale sharks, blue whales and leatherback turtles.“When you take a closer look at nature-for-debt swaps, Moody’s actually says they count as a default. [A deal] might prejudice developing countries in the long term and there are restrictions on how the money can be spent. Even after the second world war, Germany was free to decide where to invest,” he says.The concerns are echoed by Katie Kedward, a UCL research fellow, who says the agreements do not go far enough. “The pandemic has brought debt restructuring back into the conversation. In terms of sovereign debt burdens, those constraints are preventing countries from investing in conservation and adaptation to the increased risks of climate change.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Global DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Minden Pictures/Alamy“I would argue that we need to go further and look at debt forgiveness. I am hugely sceptical about how debt-for-nature swaps are being implemented in practice,” she says.Gatchev says these concerns are unfounded, pointing to case studies by TNC of deals in Belize and Barbados, which he says show that the benefit accrues to the countries. The deals are specific to the requirements of each country and try to anticipate potential problems. The Belize agreement includes natural disaster insurance, intended to avoid the scenario where the country is forced to pay for conservation instead of rebuilding after a hurricane.The reasons for entering the agreements bear striking parallels to the arguments of Lovejoy in 1984, when the idea was first developed.Experts call for ‘loss and damage’ fund for nature in developing worldRead more“As debtor nations cut back on government spending, programmes for protecting natural resources are among the first to go,” Lovejoy wrote in the New York Times at the time. “Costa Rica’s superb national park system cannot be staffed or enlarged without private donations from outside the country.“Brazil’s equivalent of the Environmental Protection Agency can do little more than pay the salaries of its employees; when fires recently broke out in its national park system, there were few guards around to fight them,” he said.In Paris, Mia Mottley’s Bridgetown agenda will attempt to reform global finance for the environmental crises of the modern age.

22, Climate protesters gather in person and online for Fridays for Future,"Campaigners target Standard Chartered, urging bank to stop funding coal in emerging markets","Climate protesters from as many as 60 countries have gathered in person and online for Fridays for Future, a movement created by the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg.Campaigners raised local issues alongside the globally co-ordinated campaign #cleanupStandardChartered, which calls on the London-headquartered Standard Chartered to divest from coal in emerging markets.Activist dives for global climate strike in first underwater protest for the planet – videoThe action follows a letter activists wrote last month to the Standard Chartered chief executive, Bill Winters, calling for the FTSE100 bank to stop funding coal.It said: “Standard Chartered is still one of the world’s largest coal-financing banks, fuelling the climate crisis.“Mr Winters, funding destruction, killing the planet, and contributing to the death of its inhabitants must stop.”Thunberg also tweeted a link to the campaign, claiming the bank had lent $24bn to coal, oil, and gas businesses since the Paris agreement on climate was signed in 2016.In the Philippines, where Standard Chartered is the biggest funder of the coal industry, activists stood outside the bank’s headquarters with banners and placards.Maths graduate and full-time activist Mitzi Jonelle Tan was part of a group that handed over a giant cheque to symbolise the amount of money the bank had lent to the coal industry in the country, which they said was $674m.She said: “Put simply, we need immediate action because the climate crisis is here and it’s only going to get worse. And we need to choose the people and the planet over profits.“That’s all we’re asking for that we listen to the science that we prioritise people because this is a matter of life and death. The climate crisis is already here.”In the UK, student activist Dominique Palmer was part of a group that protested outside the University of Birmingham and Birmingham city council calling for divestment from fossil fuels. She also took part in online activism as part of the #cleanupStandardChartered campaign, using social platforms to boost the voices of people in other parts of the world who are more directly affected by the climate crisis.Activist on hunger strike in Canada calls on government to halt loggingRead morePalmer said: “It’s so important that on this side of the world we’re also getting involved in helping pressure, and you know also helping platform, the voices of people who have already been directly impacted by it, so that’s why we’re taking action over here.”Climate activists are increasingly targeting banks. Environmental campaigners put Barclays and HSBC under pressure last year and both banks have agreed to discuss divesting from fossil fuels.A Standard Chartered spokesperson said: “We have made major strides in our coal policy over the past few years. We continue to review our positions in light of stakeholder feedback and intend to remain leaders in articulating a path to net zero by 2050. We are committed to detailed transparency on our transition strategy and plan to put it to a shareholder advisory vote in 2022.“Our position regarding coal is that we will not provide financial services directly toward new coal-fired power plant projects in any location. We will not provide financial services directly toward any coal-fired power plant expansions, retrofits or dedicated infrastructure.”","**Headline:** Climate Protesters Gather Worldwide for Fridays for Future

23, There's a simple way to make our cities greener – without a wrecking ballPhineas Harper,Architecture’s top prize has been awarded to a design duo who could show Britain how to bring its emissions under control,"This week the highest honour in the architecture world was awarded to a pair of Parisian designers better known for revitalising existing buildings than creating new ones. The Pritzker prize, which includes a $100,000 jackpot, went to Anne Lacaton and Jean-Philippe Vassal, whose most impressive projects – the Palais de Tokyo in Paris, upgrading three social housing blocks in Bordeaux, and the extension of a Dunkirk warehouse to form an arts complex – are all refurbishments.It’s the first time in the award’s 46-year history that retrofitting, the practice of upgrading buildings rather than knocking them down to start again, has triumphed. Lacaton & Vassal’s victory has shaken up the architectural profession and signals a remarkable shift in priorities among the world’s best city-makers. If embraced more widely, this could transform how buildings everywhere are regenerated.Architecture is typically obsessed with newness. A seemingly endless parade of industry awards shower gleaming new buildings with plaudits and praise. Like contemporary art, architecture thrives on the idea of originality, devaluing work that seems derivative. This thirst for novelty produces some innovative buildings, but it also results in numerous shiny baubles that appear principally designed for Instagram feeds.The humble and unphotogenic work of refurbishing, repairing, maintaining and upgrading existing buildings is rarely celebrated among city-making professionals. Despite campaigns to foreground refurbishment from the Architects’ Journal and others, awards routinely go to new buildings of questionable merit, even while older outstanding estates and community facilities are neglected.Far too often, precious buildings that serve valuable community roles have been demolished, such as Sheffield’s Hyde Park estate realised under city architect John Lewis Womersley, and Owen Luder and Rodney Gordon’s 1966 Tricorn Centre in Portsmouth, both of which lost battles against demolition proposals with disastrous environmental consequences.Building is one of the most polluting activities in the UK economy. The vast majority of the emissions it causes come from a combination of heating existing buildings and the energy expended in demolitions and new construction. At present, the sector emits the equivalent of 186 megatons of carbon dioxide a year. According to the UK Green Building Council, to meet Britain’s obligations under the 2008 Climate Change Act that level needs to more than halve by 2025, and halve again by 2050 – an enormous challenge for a notoriously slow-moving industry.Part of what makes this particularly difficult is that constructing almost anything requires vast amounts of energy. While new buildings can now be made very energy-efficient, the materials and processes required to construct them in the first place generate such high emissions that the net impact of new buildings is often arguably worse than building nothing at all. It’s a carbon catch-22 – existing British buildings are not energy-efficient enough to be sustainable, but knocking them down and erecting new ones will also emit more carbon than we can afford.Lacaton & Vassal’s Pritzker win hints at a solution. The key to bringing the environmental impact of architecture in line with planetary limits is to dramatically improve the energy efficiency of existing buildings while radically reducing new construction. In other words: less demolition, more refurbishment.Yet despite the ecological merits of refurbishment, many British local authorities consistently back demolition-led strategies (bizarrely, new construction is VAT exempt, while retrofitting is not). Councils often favour knocking down entire neighbourhoods and rebuilding them from scratch, rather than upgrading existing architecture. In Liverpool, for instance, the controversial housing market renewal initiative famously saw hundreds of good-quality terrace houses flattened to make way for development.Although it is endemic in the UK, this enormously inefficient and highly polluting model is exactly the kind of shortsighted practice that Lacaton & Vassal, with fellow French architect Frédéric Druot, attacked in their 2007 manifesto, Plus. In Plus, the designers condemned demolition-led architecture, declaring “Never demolish, never remove or replace, always add, transform, and reuse!”.This rallying cry is diametrically opposed to most British regeneration projects. For instance, rather than transforming and reusing its 1974 Central Library, Birmingham city council spent £200m building a new library and knocking down the adjacent original in 2013. The project was so costly that two years later, the city’s glamorous new library was forced to cut its opening hours and staff by almost half.The central case study of Plus is Lacaton & Vassal’s own refurbishment of a 1960s residential tower on Boulevard du Bois le Prêtre in Paris. The 96-apartment building had been badly reclad in the 1990s, and the municipality was poised to knock the tower down. The architects proposed keeping the building and using the money that would have been spent to fund its demolition and reconstruction on bolting prefabricated winter gardens to its facades instead.The resulting building provided every resident with more indoor space, huge new windows and generous balconies. It cost 62% less than a demolition-led approach would have done. The revitalised tower now runs on 60% less energy; overall, the refurbishment required 74% less energy than what would have been used in demolishing and rebuilding the block.Embracing Lacaton & Vassal’s anti-demolition tactics wouldn’t just cut emissions, it would safeguard communities and heritage too. The making of new buildings is often called “regeneration” but frequently couldn’t be further from it. Demolishing existing buildings often splits up communities that have taken generations to form. Frequently, the new facilities regeneration brings simply replace older facilities that degenerated through underfunding or were closed or relocated in preceding decades.Far better would be a Lacaton & Vassal-style strategy of maintaining and enhancing buildings. Imagine, for instance, if in the London borough of Lambeth, where the council is planning to knock down Rosemary Stjernstedt’s 450-home Central Hill Estate (one of Britain’s few modern masterpieces designed by a female architect), a refurbishment-led approach were chosen instead of outright demolition. Families wouldn’t be displaced, buildings could be upgraded efficiently, carbon emissions would fall dramatically.Lacaton & Vassal’s generous green refurbishments, now venerated by the profession’s highest award, are a lesson in how we could bring British architecture’s carbon emissions under control and protect communities from the wrecking ball. Less demolition. Less new construction. Epic world-class retrofitting instead.

24,Can we enjoy fast fashion without destroying the planet?,"The global fashion industry is in desperate need of an ecological plan, but London fashion week proved there still isn’t one – yet

Sign up here to read more exclusive pieces like this and for a digest of the week’s biggest environment stories every ThursdaySign up to Down to Earth, our exclusive weekly newsletter from our top climate crisis correspondents.How do you solve a problem like the global fashion industry? From the declining lifespan of clothes to the lightning metabolism of fashion consumerism and the increased reliance on petroleum-based synthetic fibres, this is one industry desperate for an ecological plan.London fashion week – which ended this week – showed there still isn’t one. Coverage was dominated by the launch of a new collection from one of the fastest models of production and e-retail, Pretty Little Thing, owned by the Boohoo group. It didn’t seem to matter that this show was not officially part of fashion week – it had all the ingredients of a smash hit, including a social media superstar turned creative director, Molly-Mae Hague. And, in something of a plot twist, alongside the brand’s runway show came the announcement that it will launch a pre-owned resale marketplace later this year “in a bid to encourage its shoppers to embrace sustainability”.Of course reselling, reusing and extending the lifespan of garments is critical in the fight to bring some sanity into the fashion cycle. But to push out more fast fashion and then recirculate it later seems like the fashion equivalent of carbon capture storage. It may help soothe investors, but it is unlikely to decarbonise fashion.Room for rentMeanwhile, around the same time as PLT’s announcement a genuinely important fashion industry innovator – rental platform Onloan – announced that it was pressing pause, leaving a gap in the sustainable fashion ecosystem.Fashion rental platforms all have slightly different business models. Byrotation is a peer to peer lending app, charging a borrower per loan and taking a percentage from lender and renter. There’s MyWardrobe – from former Whistles CEO Jane Shepherdson, who has said she wants renting clothes to be as commonplace as renting a car; HURR, who have teamed up with Selfridges and Hirestreet, which aims to take things mainstream, providing rental for M&S.Onloan, meanwhile, offered a subscription model. Users could rent two or four pieces a month for £69 or £99. Unusually, the company bought and held stock. For co-founder Tamsin Chislett, who has a background running a fairtrade cotton project in Uganda, this is key to re-engineering the industry. “The fashion supply chain is riven with underpayment. For us it was important to pay for actual, finished garments to allow the manufacturing part of the supply chain to work,” she says.Onloan was prepared to invest in buying wholesale, offering a royalty fee every time the piece was rented and winning the trust and partnership of prestigious yet traditional designers, such as Joseph. The theory is that getting access to these brands at a fraction of the cost is part of the alchemy that can turn consumers to renters and take the heat (and carbon) out of the system.‘Risky’ businessNot everyone is convinced, though. In particular, a report published in May 2021 by respected Finnish academics put the boot in, concluding that renting clothes was less green than other options, including throwing them away. It got a lot of coverage, including in the Guardian. Not a good day for rental.But there were flaws in that study, beginning with the fact that researchers assessed the impact of renting a pair of jeans, which are rarely borrowed from such platforms. Moreover, assumptions made on logistics and garment care (the study factors in high use of dry cleaning) were not representative of the way the business works either, with many companies using new, low-impact technology.Fashion rental entrepreneurs believe they are getting to the point when they’ll soon have the data to prove that renting is the more sustainable option. But blunt analysis also fails to recognise the really big win that platforms like Onloan have achieved. They have changed the way people think about pre-worn clothes. The stigma is disappearing (something brands like PLT are no doubt fully aware of and keen to capitalise on).But, in the end, it wasn’t an unfavourable study or even the global pandemic that did for Onloan. It was a quirk of HMRC’s tax breaks for investors in ‘risky’ startups. In effect, these exclude models that hold stock, deterring investors from Onloan’s models. (As Chislett puts it, “you want to disrupt the fashion system to make it sustainable, not to fit in with HMRC’s plans to have investors pay less tax”).And so we must say goodbye to Onloan: we shall miss you from the sustainable fashion ecosystem, but we should not forget you.","**Headline:** Fashion's Future: Can We Have It All?

25, Anti-logging protest becomes Canada’s biggest ever act of civil disobedience,"At least 866 arrested since April, as police condemned for violence against protesters defending Vancouver Island’s ancient forests","A string of protests against old-growth logging in western Canada have become the biggest act of civil disobedience in the country’s history, with the arrest of least 866 people since April.The bitter fight over the future of Vancouver Island’s diminishing ancient forests – in which activists used guerrilla methods of resistance such as locking their bodies to the logging road and police responded by beating, dragging and pepper-spraying demonstrators – has surpassed the previous record of arrests set in the 1990s at the anti-logging protests dubbed the “War in the Woods”.‘War in the woods’: hundreds of anti-logging protesters arrested in CanadaRead moreFor months, hundreds of activists with the Rainforest Flying Squad have camped out in the remote Fairy Creek watershed in a desperate attempt to shift the course of logging in the region.They have chained themselves to tripods crafted from logs, suspended themselves in trees and even locked their arms inside devices called “sleeping dragons” cemented into the ground.“We have experts in rigging, we have climbers, we have carpenters – we have all these people getting together to build amazing, beautiful things,” said Jean-François Savard, who has been at the camp since the injunction was granted to a logging company in April. “The [police] are getting very frustrated by our tenacity because we’re constantly rebuilding and coming up with new ideas. People aren’t giving up.”Members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police have been tasked with enforcing the injunction, but have increasingly faced sharp criticism for their tactics and use of force, including ripping off protesters masks to pepper-spray them and dragging them by their hair.Police have also come under fire for wearing “thin blue line” patches, obscuring their faces, not wearing name badges – and for their attempts to bar media from reporting on the long-running protests. Last month, a British Columbia supreme court judge ruled that the police force’s expulsions zones – set up to prevent media from entering certain areas of the injunction area to monitor police action – were unlawful.The RCMP did not respond to a request for comment, but Sgt Chris Manseau has previously told reporters that while police action is dictated by the actions of demonstrators and social media doesn’t show the entirety of events, a review of police action is likely.“The more violent the RCMP are, the more it radicalizes younger people. We have teenagers who are getting arrested, who are risking their lives,” said Pia Massie, who was also present at the blockages at Clayoquot Sound in 1993. “As mom, it’s very, very scary. And that’s why I keep coming back – to try to counsel people, to try to protect people.”Other veterans of the War in the Woods say the current police conduct has been “utterly disgusting”.“At Clayoquot, the relationship between us and the RCMP was almost cordial. They did their job, we did ours,” said Warren Kimmit. “That was the way policing should happen. There’s no question there’s nothing to be gained by the violence that’s happening here. And that violence is just increasing as they become frustrated with our ability to lock the road down.”At stake for the activists are swaths of old growth forest on the south-western watersheds of Vancouver Island. These trees – towering western red cedar, Douglas fir and Sitka spruce – are often hundreds of years old, and are the few remaining pockets of original old growth forest. Most have been logged.Activists have camped out in the Fairy Creek watershed in an attempt to shift the course of logging in the region. Photograph: Jen OsborneWhile the blockades have made headlines and figured into the country’s national election, they have also exposed both the legacy of old growth logging in a vulnerable ecosystem and the complex politics of the region, where a number of local First Nations receive royalties from logging operations.The Pacheedaht elected council has a revenue sharing agreement with the logging company Teal-Jones Group and have repeatedly asked demonstrators to leave the area and to respect the sovereignty of the nation.“We do not welcome or support unsolicited involvement or interference by others in our Territory, including third-party activism,” hereditary chief Frank Queesto Jones said in a letter from April.Queesto Jones and fellow chief councillor Jeff Jones say the nation has grown worried about the “increasing polarization” over forestry activities and the anti-old growth logging movement.But Pacheedaht elder Bill Jones, who has previously alleged that Frank Jones was not a true hereditary chief and did not represent the will of the nation, has become a key figure in the blockades.“We’re surprised at the RCMP’s determination to crush us. We all come to the conclusion that it’s not just us they’re wanting to crush – they want to protect the economic and regulatory process that the Canadian government uses to get what they want off the land, under the directions of the large corporations,” said Jones.Photography campaign shows the grim aftermath of logging in Canada's fragile forestsRead moreIn June, the province of British Columbia and Pacheedaht, Ditidaht and Huu-ay-aht First Nations announced a two-year moratorium on cutting, a deal that protesters rejected, pointing out that other areas – the Caycuse and Walbran valleys – are slated for logging.But those at the camps believe the confrontations at the blockades only underscore the stakes and the need for swift action to protect the few remaining stands of forest.“The civil disobedience movement is very simple. We put our bodies on the line, we almost expect to be injured, we expect to be in a very uncomfortable situation,” said Warren Kimmit. “Our willingness to do that is what causes the public to see our commitment to a cause, to rally them and to put pressure on the government to act.”","**Headline:** Civil Disobedience for the Forests

26," This article is more than 3 months oldThreats to Germany’s climate campaigners fuelled by politicians’ rhetoric, says activistThis article is more than 3 months old","Luisa Neubauer, of Fridays for Future, cites language used by the chancellor amid protest crackdown

Human rights experts warn against European crackdown on climate protesters
How criminalisation is being used to silence climate activists across the world
","Severe policing and “scary” political rhetoric is fuelling abuse against climate activists, Germany’s best-known environmentalist has said.“It’s not a shift any more, it’s a slide,” said Luisa Neubauer, from the German branch of Fridays for Future, the protest movement that grew out of Greta Thunberg’s school strikes. “There’s an increase in hate language, there’s an increase in threats, and the threats are getting more concrete. So they’re not saying any more ‘I hate you’ but they’re saying ‘We should come to your place, we should go get you.’”Germany has increasingly cracked down on climate protests as they have grown more disruptive, with police using laws designed to fight organised crime to tap phones, raid homes, freeze bank accounts and place activists in preventive detention. In September, the human rights group Amnesty International added Germany to a list of countries where the state was restricting the public’s right to protest.“The shift that we’re seeing – the sliding of societal normality – that is not just something that has to do with laws and police presence,” said Neubauer. “This is something to do with rhetoric that has been taken over in almost the entire democratic party spectrum in Germany.”A government spokesperson said Amnesty was wrong to include Germany in its map and that protest was always possible, but must be within the framework of the law. They said: “From our point of view, engagement in climate protection should unite us as a society, not divide us.”Activists argue it is the increasingly extreme rhetoric from mainstream political parties that is doing just that.Senior politicians in Germany have compared Last Generation, a nonviolent protest group that has blockaded motorways and thrown paint on glass-covered artworks, to terrorist organisations such as the Red Army Faction, a far-left group that killed dozens of people in the 1970s and 80s. Earlier this year, in tweets that have since been deleted, politicians from the centre-left and centre-right parties drew links between Last Generation and the Taliban.The chancellor, Olaf Scholz, who has described the protests as “completely idiotic”, appeared to compare climate activists to Nazis last year after two people disrupted a panel at which he was speaking in Stuttgart. “Let me say frankly, these black-clad spectacles at different events, always by the same people, remind me of a time that lies long in the past – and thank God for that,” he said, to loud applause.Scholz and his team denied he was referring to the Nazis in interviews and press conferences over the days that followed, but refused to say which other black-clad group from history he could have meant. When asked again by the Guardian whom Scholz had meant, the government spokesperson referred to a previous statement from a colleague who had said “the chancellor’s comments stand for themselves”.Neubauer, who criticised Scholz’s comparison at the time, said his language had changed the way people saw activists. “He is the leader of the country. People read his remarks … and suddenly feel a complete new ownership, accusing me and making threats against activists like me and others,” she said.A member of Neubauer’s security detail agreed with her assessment that threats against her had grown more common and concrete. The security guard shared an internal report compiled the week after the event in Stuttgart that documented “very many hate comments”, some violent and threatening, in particular under articles about Scholz. “There were often comments that Scholz was right and they [climate activists] were like the ‘Sturmabteilung’, ‘fascists’ or ‘climate terrorists’,” the report found.The threats have grown to a point where Neubauer, a 27-year-old geography student, goes to lectures with a bodyguard. She said she had to decline a recent request to sign an open letter in support of asylum seekers “because I knew that weekend my security guards were on a break”.The hate is “99.9% from men”, she added. “They had websites open where people would fantasise about how best to rape me.”Climate activists at a Fridays for Future demonstration last month at the, Brandenburg Gate, Berlin. Photograph: Marten Ronneburg/NurPhoto/ShutterstockThere was a broad swell of support in Germany for the climate movement in 2019 as Fridays for Future protests sprang up across the country. But public opinion has soured as protesters from Last Generation, who want to raise the level of urgency and put more pressure on politicians, have turned to disruptive stunts that are more likely to grab headlines and get people talking about the climate crisis.A study from More in Common, a nonprofit pushing for social cohesion, found that general support for the climate movement in Germany has fallen from 68% to 34% in the last two years. The share of people who agreed that the climate movement has “the wellbeing of all of society in mind” fell from 60% to 25%.Neubauer said there were initially lively debates within Fridays for Future about how closely to align with Last Generation, “but now after one and a half years with nothing but a political backlash this is really changing. People are worried there’s no strategy to counter the backlash.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Headlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The government strengthened the law with tougher targets for each sector of the economy. Ministers were ordered to come up with an “immediate action plan” if they failed to meet their targets.How Germany, France and Italy compare on net zero emission targetsRead moreBut since then, sectors such as transport and buildings have seen little consequence for failing to cut pollution as fast as the law requires. The government’s scientific watchdog declared the transport minister’s latest action plan too weak to qualify for a full analysis, while the environment agency said its planned measures would “barely” narrow the gap between projected emissions and targets.In June, after pressure from the Free Democrat party that controls the transport ministry, the cabinet agreed to scrap the sectoral targets from its climate law altogether.Neubauer said: “I think we will look back and they will look back and we’re going to be deeply ashamed about what is happening right now – and how we see democracies under fire from the right, but also from the climate crisis.”The government spokesperson said climate protection was a top priority for the federal government, and the goal of climate neutrality by 2045 was more important than ever. “Climate protection efforts are successful when society and the state work together. We all bear responsibility for our environment. The young generation in particular has high expectations of politics for good reasons.”The spokesperson listed several measures the government was taking to cut emissions, but did not address its failure to meet targets set out in its climate law.“Honestly, right now, I don’t know where this is going to end,” said Neubauer. “Because activists are getting more frustrated, for all the good reasons, society is getting more aggressive for their reasons, and the police are standing inbetween, but clearly taking the side of those who are attacking activists … And our politicians pretend they have nothing to do with that. That’s so cruel.”","**Headline:** Climate Activists Face Growing Threats

27, This article is more than 5 months old‘Misunderstood’ red-bellied piranhas go on display at Chester zooThis article is more than 5 months old,"Despite fearsome reputation, fish prefers scavenging to hunting and swims in shoals for protection, say experts","Forty red-bellied piranhas have made their debut at Chester zoo in a move aquarists say they hope will help to rehabilitate the fish's name away from its fearsome reputation.People associate piranhas with viciously attacking unsuspecting prey, as depicted in numerous blockbuster movies, but experts say they prefer to scavenge for food rather than hunt.It is the first time fish specialists have cared for the species at the zoo in more than 30 years.The aquarium team manager, Hannah Thomas, said piranhas were “very much misunderstood”.“They are meat-eaters with sharp teeth that sometimes nip the fins and tails of other fish,” she said. “But a good portion of their diet comes from hoovering up bits of dead flesh and dead fish found in rivers, as well as insects and various plant materials.”She said they played an important role in maintaining the balance of aquatic ecosystems and that other species would be unable to thrive without them.“Red-bellied piranhas can often be seen swimming in shoals, but this has little to do with coordinated hunting and is a lot more to do with self-defence. Piranhas often fall victim to larger fish, birds, caimans and Amazon river dolphins so, like many animals, they huddle together for protection,” Thomas said.The piranhas, which are native to South America, can now be found inside the zoo’s Spirit of the Jaguar habitat in a special Latin American tank, connecting visitors with the underwater world of the Amazon.The move is part of the zoo’s commitment to a 10-year conservation plan, which by 2031 aims to reverse the decline of 200 threatened populations of species in the wild.Chester zoo is home to 3,000 species globally, including 140 international animal conservation breeding programmes, which are ensuring the survival of species on the brink of extinction.It works with a range of partners in more than 20 countries to recover threatened wildlife and restore habitats, including orangutans in Bornean rainforests, elephants and tigers in Indian grasslands, lemurs and frogs in Malagasy forests, rare fish in Mexican lakes and a host of UK species.It is hoped that closer monitoring of the piranhas will sustain them in their role as natural balancers in the wild.“They’re a very special species and we as a team are feeling privileged to be able to start caring for them here in Chester and discovering more about them,” Thomas said.","**Headline:** Discover the Surprising Truth About Piranhas

28, This article is more than 8 months old‘Like a dam breaking’: experts hail decision to let US climate lawsuits advanceThis article is more than 8 months old,Cities bringing climate litigation against oil majors welcome US supreme court’s decision to rebuff appeal to move cases to federal courts,"The decision, climate experts and advocates said, felt “like a dam breaking” after years of legal delays to the growing wave of climate lawsuits facing major oil companies.Without weighing in on the merits of the cases, the supreme court on Monday rebuffed an appeal by major oil companies that want to face the litigation in federal courts, rather than in state courts, which are seen as more favorable to plaintiffs.ExxonMobil Corp, Suncor Energy Inc and Chevron Corp had asked for the change of venue in lawsuits by the state of Rhode Island and municipalities in Colorado, Maryland, California and Hawaii.‘Appalling’ Earth Day greenwashing must not detract from message, says protest founderRead moreSix years have passed since the first climate cases were filed in the US, and courts have not yet heard the merits of the cases as fossil fuel companies have succeeded in delaying them. In March, the Biden administration had argued that the cases belonged in state court, marking a reversal of the position taken by the Trump administration when the supreme court last considered the issue.The Rhode Island attorney general, Peter Neronha, said his state was now finally preparing for trial after “nearly half a decade of delay tactics” by the industry. A joint statement from the California cities of Santa Cruz, San Mateo and Richmond and Marin county said the oil companies knew the dangers of fossil fuels but “deceived and failed to warn consumers about it even as they carried on pocketing trillions of dollars in profits”.The cases have been compared to tobacco lawsuits in the 1990s that resulted in a settlement of more than $200bn and changed how cigarettes are advertised and sold in the US.“It was a really amazing feeling to see that the supreme court was ruling in a very logical way by continuing with the unanimous decisions that have been made in the previous courts to not [grant petitions for review] and to allow these cases to move forward,” said Delta Merner, lead scientist at the Science Hub for Climate Litigation.“It removes this dam that industry has been building to prevent these cases from being heard on their merits,” she said. “We can finally have the real conversations about what the industry knew and what their actions were despite that knowledge.”She hopes communities will have the chance to speak in court about the climate emergencies they are experiencing as a result of the industry’s actions.As jurisdictional battles have dragged on, climate emergencies have added up.The Suncor oil refinery in Commerce City, Colorado. Photograph: Ted Wood/The GuardianThe Colorado case was filed in 2018. In 2021, the state saw the Marshall fire, the most destructive wildfire in its history, which killed two people, destroyed nearly 1,000 homes and businesses, contaminated drinking water and amounted to billions in damages.“There’s real impacts that are happening now, and that’s why it’s so important for these cases to have the opportunity to be heard, and have a chance for justice,” Merner said.The cases allege fossil fuel companies exacerbated climate change by concealing and misrepresenting the dangers associated with burning fossil fuels. The lawsuits say the companies created a public and private nuisance and violated state consumer protection laws by producing and selling fossil fuels despite knowing the products would cause devastating climate emergencies, including melting ice caps, dramatic sea level rise, and extreme precipitation and drought. Local governments are seeking damages for the billions of dollars they have paid for climate mitigation and adaptation.The oil companies have denied the allegations.Financial accountability“We were all pretty excited. It feels like justice might be possible,” Richard Wiles, president of the Center for Climate Integrity, said after reading the decision on Monday.“There’s clearly trillions of dollars of damages in the US alone from climate change that has to be dealt with.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Rulings against the companies could also reinforce banking industry concerns that fossil fuels are a risky investment.In state court, fossil fuel companies will attempt to have the cases dismissed.The Chevron attorney Theodore Boutrous said in a statement he was confident the cases would be dismissed, arguing that climate change requires a coordinated federal response, “not a disjointed patchwork” of actions from numerous state courts. “These wasteful lawsuits in state courts will do nothing to advance global climate solutions, nothing to reduce emissions and nothing to address climate-related impacts,” he said.“I don’t think there’s any reason for that confidence yet,” said Korey Silverman-Roati, climate law fellow at the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, in response to Boutrous.There’s a growing number of lawsuits. And I imagine after today, that will continueDelta Merner of the Science Hub for Climate LitigationIt’s unclear what will happen in state courts, but Silverman-Roati pointed to the Hawaii case, in which a state court denied the industry’s motion to dismiss.If plaintiffs clear motions to dismiss, the cases move to discovery. The plaintiffs will use the process to try to gather more evidence of what the companies knew and when they knew it. Internal company documents will probably become public when the trials get under way.Recent studies have shown that Exxon accurately predicted that its products would cause climate change.Attribution science will play a key role in connecting local climate disasters to the industry’s responsibility. “Studies can explain how much hotter a heatwave is, or how much greater the intensity of a downpour is during a hurricane event due to climate change. And they can look to see where those emissions came from, and what percentage of those emissions tie into those direct climate impacts,” Merner said.With each decision in favor of plaintiffs, the cases are snowballing and more local governments are filing new cases. “There’s a growing number of lawsuits. And I imagine after today, that will continue,” Merner said.","**Headline:** Climate Justice Prevails

29, This article is more than 10 months oldUS justice department sues two companies over pollution in Louisiana’s ‘Cancer Alley’This article is more than 10 months old,"Japanese company Denka, along with US chemicals giant DuPont, have operated the plant that produces cancer-causing chloroprene","The US justice department has sued the two petrochemical giants behind a facility in Louisiana’s “Cancer Alley” responsible for the highest cancer risk rates caused by air pollution in the US in a major federal lawsuit that seeks to substantially curb the plant’s emissions.Unveiled on Tuesday, the lawsuit alleges emissions at the Pontchartrain Works facility in Reserve, Louisiana, violate the Clean Air Act and “present an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and welfare”.Cancer and chemicals in Reserve, Louisiana: the science explainedRead moreThe move marks a significant escalation of the Biden administration’s enforcement action in the Cancer Alley region, and was instantly hailed by members of the predominantly Black community around the plant as a major victory in their ongoing campaign for clean air.Suing on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the justice department is now seeking a federal court order to compel Denka (DPE), the Japanese chemical giant operating the facility, to “immediately take all necessary measures” to curb emissions of the compound chloroprene, labeled by the EPA as a likely human carcinogen.The facility is the only site in the US to emit the compound, which is a primary constituent of the synthetic rubber neoprene. EPA air monitoring around the facility has consistently shown readings well in excess of the recommended lifetime exposure limit of 0.2 micrograms per cubic meter.“This will have a tremendous impact on our struggle here,” said Robert Taylor, a founder of Concerned Citizens of St John Parish. “Over the six years we have been fighting this fight we haven’t had anything as great as this to happen in terms of getting concrete action on emissions.”Speaking to the Guardian, Taylor added: “The state government has totally ignored us – marches on the capitol, rallying – they wouldn’t even give us an audience. And for the administration to come in and do this, it just validates our efforts.”EPA administrator Michael Regan said in a statement that he had promised “strong action” for community members during a site visit to Reserve in November 2021.“This complaint filed against Denka delivers on that promise,” Regan said. “The company has not moved far enough or fast enough to reduce emissions or ensure the safety of the surrounding community. This action is not the first step we have taken to reduce risks to the people living in St John the Baptist Parish, and it will not be the last.”The Fifth Ward elementary school and residential neighborhoods sit near the Denka plant, back left, in Reserve, Louisiana. Photograph: Gerald Herbert/APA statement issued by Denka on Tuesday said the company “strongly disagrees” with the legal action and urged the EPA to re-evaluate its findings on chloroprene exposure. The company has been lobbying the federal government for years, claiming the compound’s peer-reviewed classification is based on outdated science.“DPE is in compliance with its air permits and applicable law. EPA is taking an unprecedented step – deviating from its permitting and rulemaking authorities – to allege an ‘emergency’ based on outdated and erroneous science the agency released over 12 years ago,” the statement said.The lawsuit also names a subsidiary of the US chemicals giant DuPont, which constructed the Pontchartrain Works facility as a neoprene plant and operated it for over half a century.DuPont sold the plant to Denka in 2015 in a secretive deal, which the Guardian later revealed was motivated by concerns from DuPont that it would face heavier regulation after the EPA’s decision to classify chloroprene as a likely human carcinogen. The revelations were part of a years-long Guardian series examining air pollution in Reserve and throughout Cancer Alley.DuPont remains the owner of the land beneath Denka’s facility and acts as a landlord, according to the complaint, meaning DuPont may need to grant permissions in order for emissions to be reduced.DuPont did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In a statement, associate attorney general Vanita Gupta said: “The justice department’s environmental justice efforts require ensuring that every community, no matter its demographics, can breathe clean air and drink clean water. Our suit aims to stop Denka’s dangerous pollution.”The lawsuit contains further details of the plant’s recent chloroprene emissions, which fell after Denka constructed emissions offset technology after its purchase of the plant, but still remains dangerously high and in some locations 14 times over the recommended exposure limit.According to EPA calculations in the suit, current chloroprene emissions present a risk “that is especially grave for infants and children under the age of 16”. The suit claims that emissions remain so high that a child breathing air near certain monitors around the facility’s fence line would exceed their lifetime excess cancer risk within two years.Either they use their money and do it right or face the power of the EPAMary Hampton of Concerned Citizens of St John Parish“In the aggregate, the thousands of people breathing this air are incurring a significantly higher cancer risk than would be typically allowed, and they are being exposed to a much greater cancer risk from Denka’s air pollution than the majority of United States residents face,” the suit states.The justice department complaint does not directly specify that Denka should reduce its emissions to the 0.2 micrograms lifetime exposure recommendation, but cites the guidance throughout the complaint.Mary Hampton, another founder of Concerned Citizens of St John Parish, said the lawsuit was the culmination of years of advocacy from community members and represented that “finally we have a little hope”.“This makes me feel like we have something to look forward to, not five or 10 years from now – we need it to happen now.”Hampton urged both Denka and DuPont to comply with the federal government’s demands set forth in the lawsuit.“They know they can comply,” Hampton said. “And either they use their money and do it right or face the power of the EPA.”","**Headline:** Justice Department Sues Over Pollution in 'Cancer Alley'

But as visitors slowly return, the sector is looking for new ways to thrive","Every day, for the past 20 years, Joyce Naserian has laid out her handmade curios near an entrance to the Masai Mara park to sell to passing tourists. Her earnings have helped the 46-year-old feed and educate all four of her children.In northern Kenya, about 1,200 semi-nomadic women earned more than 9m Kenyan shillings (£62,000) selling beadwork to visitors at 43 community wildlife conservancies in 2020. Just as it was Naserian in the Mara, selling the beadwork was a solid money earner for these women. But that was before Covid.The collapse of eco-tourism during the pandemic has spelled disaster for conservation initiatives and livelihoods in Kenya and beyond. Cuts to budgets and staff, reduced salaries and stalled development and education projects have plunged communities into poverty, leading to a rise in poaching and the illegal wildlife trade.Reuters reported that in the first three months of 2020, the African continent lost $55bn (£44bn) in travel and tourism revenues – funds that go towards running conservation programmes that benefit local communities.A Maasai woman with her display of decorative beads and other traditional items for tourists.

Photograph: Kathy Hancock/AlamyKenya’s government has relaxed a raft of travel restrictions, but the return of international tourists has been slow, while concerns about carbon emissions from long-haul air travel may be putting people off flying into conservation areas.“It is a real struggle for survival,” says Daniel Sopia, head of Masai Mara Wildlife Conservancies Association. “Women who relied solely on beadwork were badly affected as there was not a single tourist coming to the Mara at the height of Covid-19 restrictions. Household income dropped significantly and they had to rely on food from well-wishers.”The 15 wildlife conservancies that Sopia heads comprise individual blocks of land owned by Maasai people. The landowners lease the land, covering 14,0426 hectares (347,000 acres), to safari camps and lodges, which pay fees that fund projects providing water, healthcare and education, as well as setting up small businesses.In return, the 14,500 landowners protect biodiversity within the Mara ecosystem while preserving their traditional lifestyle.Four years before the pandemic, the conservancies contributed almost 120m Kenyan shillings to social programmes in the region. Two years ago, payments to landowners fell by 50%, forcing conservancies to scale back operations and focus on priorities such as allowances to wildlife rangers. Sopia and his team had to scramble to prevent the total collapse of conservation programmes.“Conservancies remained operational throughout the pandemic despite the lack in tourism income,” says Sopia. “We were fortunate to mobilise some resources from development partners and private foundations. These helped to cover rangers’ salaries, food rations, fuel, and vehicle maintenance.“We hope the arrangement will be in place till June 2022 as we slowly wean the conservancies off such aid,” he says.A Maasai man wears traditional beaded bracelets. Photograph: Eric Lafforgue/Art in All of Us/Corbis/Getty ImagesSome foreign organisations are now making a comeback after a two-year hiatus. In March 2022, UK charity Tusk brought together conservation professionals from across Africa for a symposium in Masai Mara to help organisations diversify fundraising and build resilient units.Since 1990, Tusk has raised more than £80m towards conservation projects across more than 20 African countries and helped to protect more than 40 threatened species. Tusk’s upcoming Wildlife Ranger Challenge seeks to raise money for rangers whose pay was slashed in the pandemic.“The last two years have been extremely tough for everyone. The conservation sector in particular has had to endure huge losses, dramatic cutbacks in operating budgets, and, sadly, redundancies,” says Charlie Mayhew, Tusk Trust chief executive.Wanjiku Kinuthia, strategyhead at Maliasili, hopes the renewed interest in broadening discussions about African conservation will boost small organisations that are often left out of big decisions, despite being closest to the vulnerable communities bearing the brunt of a collapsing environment.Africa’s park tourism crash is a wake-up call. Can we find new ways to finance conservation? | Peter MuiruriRead more“They often miss out on global dialogues,” says Kinuthia, whose group supports about 20 other organisations in seven countries, including smaller ones that lack the networks to make their voices heard. “They do not understand how the media works or how to tell their stories. We can be catalysts of change for such grassroots organisations.”Involving communities in conservation would safeguard the 65% of wildlife that lives outside protected areas, she says. “All people need are tools to help them coexist with animals in the 21st century while benefiting from conservation.”However, some conservationists say the only way to sustain conservation programmes and avoid disruption is by governments increasing budgets to the sector, a challenge considering the current low levels of state investment.Dickson Kaelo, who heads the Kenya Wildlife Conservancies Association, says African countries depend on foreign donors to fund development and conservation is no exception.“There is no single answer to cutting off foreign aid,” says Kaelo. “There are no government incentives for setting up a conservancy to protect an elephant that walks all over destroying life and property.“If you are in the farming sector, you can get a loan to buy a tractor, but there is no institution that gives loans for those who want to invest in protecting wildlife, and while a person buying a vehicle to ferry tourists gets some tax rebates, we get no such benefits when buying a truck for wildlife rangers.”He adds: “Through a private member’s bill, parliament might create laws that hamper conservation including the Natural Resources (Benefits Sharing) Bill, with a formula that will see those in conservation give 80% of their proceeds to government and a paltry 12.8% to local communities.In addition, the government requires that you come up with a management plan, a strategic and environmental study, multiple registration procedures and other permits before setting up a private conservancy. If you want to lease land you have to pay 2% stamp duty for the entire period, say for 20 years, and pay that upfront. Why don’t we see such laws when someone wants to cut down a tree?”Kaddu Sebunya, chief executive at the African Wildlife Foundation says Africans must be exposed to the benefits of wildlife and wild lands so they can lead on conservation. A starting point would be to make tourism more accessible, he says, “as it is easier for someone in New York or Sydney to book a tour to Africa than someone living in Harare or Lagos.”.“Building our domestic and regional tourism market will be a stepping stone to increasing the African voice for conservation. While millions of Africans traverse the continent to travel for business, how can these numbers be translated to nature tourists?“Data from Unctad [UN Conference on Trade and Development] indicates that four out of 10 international tourists in Africa come from the continent, and this begs the question, ‘is our product marketing catering to the four Africans?’It is high time for a shift in mindset,” says Sebunya.Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:Sign up for Global Dispatch – please check your spam folder for the confirmation email","**Headline:** Kenya's Wildlife Needs Your Help

31, ‘Extinct’ parrots make a flying comeback in Brazil,"The Spix macaw, a bird that had once vanished in the wild, is now thriving in its South American homeland after a successful breeding programme","Twenty years ago, the future of the Spix’s macaw could not have looked bleaker. The last member of this distinctive parrot species disappeared from the wild, leaving only a few dozen birds in collectors’ cages across the globe. The prospects for Cyanopsitta spixii were grim, to say the least.But thanks to a remarkable international rescue project, Spix’s macaws – with their grey heads and vivid blue plumage – have made a stunning comeback. A flock now soars freely over its old homeland in Brazil after being released there a month ago. Later this year, conservationists plan to release more birds, and hope the parrots will start breeding in the wild next spring.A macaw wildlife refuge has been established in the north-eastern state of Bahia in Brazil“The project is going extremely well,” said biologist Tom White, of the US Fish and Wildlife Service and a technical adviser to the rescue project. “It’s almost a month since we released the birds and all of them have survived.“They are acting as a flock; they are staying in the vicinity of their release and they are beginning to sample local vegetation. It’s going as well as it possibly could.”The Spix’s macaw – named in honour of the German biologist Johann Baptist Ritter von Spix, who first collected a specimen in 1819 – became the victim of a double environmental whammy that began in the 19th century. As farming spread across South America, the parrot’s homeland – in an area of shrubland and thorn forest known as the Caatinga in north-east Brazil – was overgrazed by goats and other livestock. The land was severely eroded, and macaw numbers dropped as their habitat was destroyed.“That loss in numbers had a very unfortunate secondary effect,” said White. “As soon as an animal becomes endangered, collectors want to have one. And that is what happened to the Spix’s macaw. They became rare and, as a result, unscrupulous individuals decided to try to take the few that remained in the wild for their private collections.”The future for the species looked dismal until the bird’s fortunes were revived by, of all things, an animated film. Rio, the story of a domesticated male Spix’s macaw called Blu, who is taken to Rio de Janeiro to mate with a free-spirited female, Jewel, was released in 2011. The film, and its sequel, Rio 2, earned almost $1bn. Crucially, the films revealed the threat facing the species to a global audience.The 2011 animation Rio, the story of a domesticated Spix’s macaw, revealed the predicament of the species to a global audience. Photograph: 20th Century Fox/Sportsphoto/AllstarLater, in 2018, Michel Temer, then president of Brazil, signed a decree that established a macaw wildlife refuge in the north-eastern state of Bahia, while a breeding programme, using parrots from private collections, was established at various centres across the world. A key player in this collaboration was the German-based organisation the Association for the Conservation of Threatened Parrots.The growing sophistication of modern genetics also played an important role in saving the Spix’s macaw, said White.“When you are trying to build up numbers of animals from a very small surviving population, inbreeding can be a real problem. However, the techniques used to check the genetic status of these birds were very, very sophisticated and allowed breeders to match birds very carefully.“Artificial insemination has also made it easier to produce offspring from birds.”As a result, several hundred Spix’s macaws have now been bred in captivity, and eight of these were taken in June to Bahia for release. And they had company: along with the Spix’s macaws, eight Illiger’s macaws were also let loose on 11 June.White said: “The Spix’s macaws that we now possess are the end result of generations of captive breeding, and that will have taken the edge off some of their instinctive survival skills.“However, by mixing them with Illiger’s macaws – who were basically just wild birds brought briefly into captivity – the Spix’s benefit by associating with a native species that is sharp and alert, and can show them where they get food and alert them to potential predators.”The birds, each tagged with radio transmitters, are now being monitored carefully. “We will release another 12 Spix’s macaws in December if everything goes well,” added White.“These birds will all be of reproductive age. We have also ensured there are several nest cavities, some natural and artificial, in the area to encourage the birds to begin mating next year and eventually establish breeding territories in the area.“It’s ambitious but so far things are going well.”","**Headline**: Extinct Parrots Make a Comeback

","An application by mining company Glencore to build a massive toxic tailings dump on the edge of a sacred site has been rejected by the Northern Territory government.The controversial McArthur River mine, which is one of world’s largest zinc and lead mines, is roughly 900km south-east of Darwin and borders the Barramundi Dreaming sacred site, near Borroloola.On Tuesday, NT heritage minister, Chansey Paech, tabled a decision in parliament to reject an application to build the rock dump – which would stand as the largest built structure in the Northern Territory – to within 35 metres of the site.Josie Davey, a Gudanji woman and traditional owner of the mine site, and her husband, Jack Green, a senior Garawa lawman, welcomed the decision saying the company would now have to negotiate properly with traditional owners.“It was the best thing,” Green said. “It should have happened before, properly, if they were to come and sit down and talk to the traditional owners of the area. All of us are happy now, it took us a long time to come to an agreement like this.”They described the proposal as a “new mountain” and Davey said significant damage had already been done by the company over the past two decades.“I feel sad at what they have done. Because this is my great, great-grandfather’s country. And for our people,” Davey said.‘Legacy of sadness’: Glencore says sorry to traditional owners over NT mine as it seeks expansionRead moreUnder its expansion plans, Glencore – which took over the mine in 2006 – sought to expand its tailings dump to within 35 metres of the Barramundi Dreaming sacred site, which rises to a height of 80 metres, and is one of 24 sacred sites on the mine lease.The dump would stand at a height of 140 metres, with a 6km square footprint, making it taller than the Sydney Harbour Bridge at 134 metres with an area larger than Uluru, which measures roughly 3.33km square.

The weight of the structure would have likely altered the groundwater table and would need to be monitored for 1,000 years due to the high acid content of the waste rock. The highly combustible rock dissolves easily and the chemical runoff can seep into groundwater and nearby river systems.There is also another valuable archaeological site in the area, an ancient stone quarry that is part of local songlines and where local Aboriginal people mass produced stone tools, axe heads, knives and spear tips.This site is not covered in Tuesday’s decision and Glencore has made a separate application with Paech to demolish it. The company continues to widen the tailings dump while it waits for approval to build higher.In making its application, the company claimed it had consulted with traditional owners but when the Aboriginal Areas Protection Authority (AAPA) reviewed the matter, they determined the agreement was invalid.None of the site’s 180 custodians had been consulted while the six signatories who had did not necessarily understand what they agreed to or were not given copies of the contract.AAPA CEO Dr Benedict Scambary said Tuesday’s decision demonstrated that negotiation with traditional owners was “not a box to be ticked”.‘It should have happened before’: Gudanji woman and traditional owner Josie Davey and her husband Jack Green, a senior Garawa lawman, on the McArthur River crossing bridge. Photograph: Rebecca Parker“One of the things this decision will do is put other proponents of development in the Northern Territory on notice that murky deals done without representation, that are designed to disempower Aboriginal people in the protection of the sacred sites and cultural heritage, won’t pass muster,” he said.Co-director of the Environment Centre NT, Kirsty Howey, also said the decision was a “watershed” moment in the history of an “extraordinarily damaging mine authorised in extraordinary circumstances”.“We’ve never seen a Labor government minister in the NT back traditional owners on this mine which has been enormously destructive and damaging to traditional owners for years,” Howey said.“Minister Paech should be applauded for having the backbone to stand up to Glencore.”The NT Environment Centre is currently involved in legal action against the territory government over approvals given by Nicole Manison in 2020 for its expansion.A spokesperson for McArthur River mine said in a statement the company is in negotiations with the Northern Land Council, acting on behalf of traditional owners, but “remains committed to further developments at our mine site”.Cost to rehabilitate Kakadu uranium mine site could blow out by $1.2bnRead more“We remain committed to these negotiations and broad consultation with traditional owners on a variety of matters, including sacred sites and cultural heritage protection, to ensure the benefits of our operations are shared with TOs and the wider community.”The McArthur River mine has been subject to several current and historical litigations, and was a suspected source of lead contamination in drinking water used by the Borroloola’s Aboriginal community until an investigation found there was no indication the contamination was related to the mine.An effort to keep the company from diverting the river in order to allow it to mine the riverbed was successful in court but ultimately overridden by the NT Government to allow work to proceed.The company apologised for its treatment of Aboriginal people and traditional owners in 2021, and specifically for the river diversion.","**Headline**: NT Government Rejects Glencore's Toxic Dump Proposal

33,,"One of the world’s great natural spectacles is under way in the eastern US, stretching from the deep south to upstate New York","At first, the noise pulsing from the drooping elm tree boughs seemed to be coming from the power lines erected nearby. Like a surging electrical current, the sound fizzed to a crescendo on the ears before receding slightly, only to build up again to a loud, vibrating whirr.It was only on the approach to the tree, as desiccated bodies crunched underfoot and small but sturdy creatures sporting wings and orange eyes suddenly clung on to our calf muscles, that it became apparent what was causing such a huge racket: millions of cicadas had just erupted from the earth.One of the world’s great natural spectacles is under way in the eastern US, stretching from the deep south to upstate New York. Trillions of periodic cicadas are emerging en masse from a 17-year dormancy underground to clamber up trees, let out calls that rattle the eardrums, furiously mate and hand off the next leg of an extraordinary evolutionary cycle to their offspring.“This is a spectacular chorus, just incredible” said Michael Raupp, an entomologist at the University of Maryland who happily lets one of the insects crawl up his cheek. We are beside a small stand of trees in Columbia, Maryland, a leafy commuter suburb near Washington. It’s swelteringly hot, a pleasing temperature for the screeching cicadas.cicadas on michaelLeft: Cicadas crawl up the face of entomologist Michael Raupp in Columbia, Maryland, on 21 May. Right: A cicada on a leaf. Photographs by Gabriella Demczuk/The GuardianCicadas swarm the trees of a home in Columbia, Maryland, on 21 May. Photograph: Gabriella Demczuk/The GuardianThe scene is not only raucous – a swarm of cicadas can produce a sound that reaches around 100 decibels, louder than a revving motorcycle – but also grisly. Cicadas flail around in a stupor on their backs, some lie squashed, others are picked off by a red-shouldered hawk that is shoveling insects into the gaping maws of two ravenous chicks in a nearby nest. The amber-colored exoskeletons shed by the cicadas litter the seething ground and pockmark the trunk and branches of the elm tree.Millions, perhaps billions, of the insects don’t even make it to this point. In the past 17 years, much of the ground containing cicadas has been paved over for roads and driveways and shopping malls. Their foot-deep refuges became tombs, even before the cicadas could run the gauntlet of the overland.Raupp scrabbled in the dirt to show the small holes where more fortunate cicadas managed to tunnel to daylight using their shovel-like front legs. At first, the nymphs are a ghostly white before shedding their skins and developing a hardened exoskeleton. The task is to then ascend a tree, with the males creating what Raupp calls a “big boy band” of noise to attract females for mating.Some broods emerge in 13-year cycles and others in 17-year periods and while there is no definitive explanation for this phenomenon, many entomologists believe the cicadas have developed this as a defensive move against predators. No foe – squirrel, hawk or raccoon – will live the 17 years to lie in wait, with the massed synchronized numbers always allowing enough survivors to breed and kickstart the next generation. Underground, the cicadas either track the passing years from the burst in plant activity each spring or rely upon some sort of internal clock, their own circadian rhythm.Cicadas swarm in a box at the home of entomologist Michael Raupp in Columbia, Maryland. Photograph: Gabriella Demczuk/The GuardianBoth males and females are drawn to the males with the loudest calls, again to build strength in numbers. One of the elm trees is dominated by cassinii, the cicada species that produces the juddering electrical circuit noise that, when up close, sounds like the clicking of a million tiny castanets. But amid the heaving mass of bodies there is also a stray septendecim, a different type of cicada that makes a more ethereal “woo-hoo” call.We hunt for the stray noise until Raupp finds the caller and squeezes him gently between thumb and forefinger, causing the cicada to let out a squeak similar to the sound of shoes on a basketball court. Visible on the cicada is its tymbal, a membrane on the drum-like abdomen that is vibrated to make its distinctive noise. “The males are singing their brains out to bring as many people to the party as they can,” said Raupp, as he looked at the rogue septendecim. “But if you want to hook up, you better be in the right bar.”If a female takes a shine to a male’s call, she will flick her wings to signal mating can occur. Females will then cut a slit into a branch to deposit a clutch of 20 to 30 eggs via their ovipositors, a tubular egg-laying organ. Once hatched, these nymphs will then drop to the soil to bury themselves to begin the next stanza in the cicadas’ story.But even the carnal stage is fraught with danger. We spot one cicada slowly ambling up the tree trunk with a noticeably white rear end – a sign it has been infected by a psychedelic fungus called Massospora, which produces an amphetamine in the insects that causes their bottoms to fall off before they mate uncontrollably with both male and female cicadas, spreading the fungus further.Left: The sturdy creatures sport wings and orange eyes. Right: The amber-colored exoskeletons shed by the cicadas litter the ground.Left: The sturdy creatures sport wings and orange eyes.

Photograph: Gabriella Demczuk/The GuardianRaupp, who is wearing a T-shirt with a giant cicada emblazoned upon it, is a vocal proponent of the species, once seasoning a few cicadas, placing them on a skewer and smuggling them into his carry-on baggage in order to travel to California and appear on Jay Leno’s late night talkshow. The host gamely ate the crunchy delicacy but Russell Crowe, a guest on the TV show, demurred. “He whispered to me ‘there’s no way I’m eating that, mate’,” Raupp recalled. “I like them, they’ve got a nutty sort of flavor. Leno said they tasted better than Cheetos.”Many people share Crowe’s antipathy, however. Raupp said a friend quizzed him on when the cicadas were emerging so that he could book a lengthy holiday to Idaho to escape their arrival. A woman in Ohio has created a body shield made of shower curtains to avoid any contact with them. Police in Georgia have begged people to stop calling 911 to report the loud noise the cicadas make. A CNN newsreader, reporting how a Maryland company was selling cicadas dipped in chocolate, broke off to admit “I’m so sick to my stomach reading this.”This reaction can be understandable when dealing with a creature measuring two inches long that resembles a cockroach with the startling addition of orange eyes. “They don’t bite or sting you, there’s nothing to fear from them,” said Raupp, as a cadre of cicadas crawled up his leg. “But some people are phobic and I take that seriously. To have thousands of cicadas emerge at once around you can be traumatic.”The cicadas would have more well-founded fears of us, however. The insects typically wait for soils to reach 64F to emerge, a level of warmth that is arriving several weeks earlier in the year than it was in the 1970s due to global heating, climate scientists have said. Their range is also edging northwards as their environment heats up, pushing them to an unknown fate.The rapid development of their habitat, meanwhile, has already wiped out several broods in the US. Even if all of these risks are avoided, cicadas’ stars are destined to burn brightly but quickly – once free from their 17-year dormancy, they will all be dead within a month once their reproductive goals are met.“It’s a changing planet and it will affect cicadas like everything else,” said Raupp. “But their lineage goes back several million years and perhaps they will adapt. They really are amazing things.”","**Witness the Natural Spectacle of the Cicadas!**

34, Iguanas with chips: Florida seeks solution to invasive reptile problem,‘Tag day’ initiative opposed by some owners of exotic petsState official ‘proud that Florida is looked at as a leader’,"From Key West’s high-summer Hemingway Days, in which bearded hopefuls vie for the title of best Papa lookalike, to the annual hunt for the elusive (and imaginary) skunk ape, Florida is renowned for its calendar of curiosities.Toilet-invading iguanas among invasive species now banned in FloridaRead moreNow another bizarre date has been added to the list: tag your reptile day.Owners of tegus, a non-native species of giant central and south American lizard, and green iguanas, another prolific invader, must get their reptiles microchipped like any conventional pet.Seeking compliance with a regulation passed in February to protect against invasive species and which came into effect this weekend, the Florida fish and wildlife commission (FWC) has established tag day, actually a series of dates in the coming weeks at venues around the state.“Just as with cats and dogs, microchipping your green iguana or tegu is one of the simplest and most effective ways to keep them safe while also protecting Florida’s native wildlife,” said Kristen Sommers, FWC head of wildlife impacts management.The microchipping days, sure to raise eyebrows in the waiting rooms of veterinarians’ offices, are part of a 90-day grace period. After that, tegus and green iguanas must be permitted and chipped.A further three-month period will allow owners time to comply with new requirements for outdoor caging, which also apply to the other 14 non-native species covered by the new regulation, including Burmese and other species of pythons, green anacondas and Nile monitors.“These animals are creating enormous issues for our state,” said the FWC chairman, Rodney Barreto, of regulations meant to reduce the release of nuisance species into the wild.“I have always been proud that Florida is looked at as a leader. Let’s take a bold stance. We have to put our foot down. The time has come, and we hope other states will follow.”Florida has about 500 non-native species, many of which have caused massive damage to a sensitive ecosystem. Among the worst offenders are Burmese pythons, which have run rampant in the Everglades and other waterways, depleting stocks of deer, rodents and wading birds.A woman holds an Argentine black and white tegu. Photograph: Mladen Antonov/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Argentinian black and white tegu, which can grow to the size of a dog, has become problematic particularly in the south of the state. Since 2012, at least 7,800 have been found dead or removed from the wild by FWC staff or hunters.Green iguanas can grow to more than 5ft and weigh up to 17lb. According to the FWC, they cause damage by digging burrows that erode and collapse sidewalks, foundations, seawalls, berms and canal banks.The agency encourages the humane killing and removal of both species in the wild.Some who keep the creatures as pets are not so welcoming of the new regulations.“This is absolutely ridiculous,” one owner, Marie Lewis, posted on the Hernando Reptile and Exotics Rescue Facebook page. “We are all being punished for idiot caretakers. I understand the possibility of invasive species but some of us actually care for our reptiles.”","**Headline:** Iguanas on the Loose: Protect Florida's Wildlife

35, Push for post-Brexit trade deals may threaten UK pledges on deforestation,Government criticised over ‘indefensible’ proposal that could undermine climate efforts while yielding benefit of only £1.38m,"The UK government may be undermining its commitments to end deforestation overseas because of conflicts over trade policy, the Guardian has learned.A war of words is raging within the government over deforestation and trade, with green campaigners warning that a proposed policy could have dire consequences for efforts to stop illegal logging.Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the international trade secretary, is believed to want to relax tariffs for goods including palm oil from Malaysia, a country of top concern over deforestation. The relaxation would be part of a broader push for trade deals with developing countries that the government is pursuing in the wake of Brexit.The UK wants to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), which includes Malaysia, by dropping generic trade tariffs. Negotiations began under the former trade secretary Liz Truss, who is running as a Tory leadership candidate.However, the removal of tariffs without any green strings attached would undercut the UK’s parallel efforts to end illegal deforestation overseas, one of the centrepieces of the deal that ministers forged at the UN Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow last year.Sam Lawson, the director of the UK campaign group Earthsight, who has spent many years investigating deforestation for palm oil in Malaysia, said: “This proposal to slash tariffs on Malaysian palm oil without any conditions regarding the devastating deforestation those imports are known to cause is utter madness. Instead of addressing the cost of living crisis, this government is using it as a hollow excuse for ditching its own climate goals in a craven effort to get another trade agreement under its belt.”The UK’s Environment Act, which was passed last year, makes provision for due diligence when companies import goods, including palm oil, from overseas countries where deforestation is rife. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is currently consulting on the exact form this due diligence will take in practice.Fury as government waters down post-Brexit food standardsRead moreIf import regulations are relaxed for Malaysia without due diligence safeguards in place, it could give countries where deforestation is happening the hope of avoiding any of the sanctions provided for in the Environment Act, rendering the government’s green pledges toothless. Countries such as Indonesia and Brazil would be likely to press for similar deals, according to campaigners.The Guardian has seen a strongly worded letter to Trevelyan from Zac Goldsmith, an environment minister and member of the House of Lords, querying her stance. He cited research showing that liberalising trade in the way the Department for International Trade (DIT) is considering for Malaysia would yield an economic benefit of only about £1.38m for the whole of the UK.“If we go for the full liberalisation, we are choosing to U-turn on the very core of our Cop26 messaging on the importance of forests,” he wrote. “We obviously cannot continue leading global efforts to break the link between commodities and deforestation if in our own trade policy we are encouraging the opposite.”In the letter, dated 28 June, he added: “It is clear this isn’t an authentic ‘cost of living’ decision; it is a values decision. And I am struggling to understand who we are trying to appeal to with these appalling values? Or how we are supposed to defend this entirely indefensible position, for example in Lib Dem target seats?”Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BSTThe DIT said it could not comment on live negotiations. A spokesperson told the Guardian: “We are firmly committed to maintaining our high domestic standards of environmental protection in trade agreements, and CPTPP includes environmental provisions to support these objectives. The UK has convened over 25 major trading countries to agree action to protect forests through the forest, agriculture and commodity trade dialogue, and is taking forward measures under the Environment Act to make it illegal for businesses to use key commodities if they have not been produced in line with local laws protecting forests and other natural ecosystems.”The production of palm oil, which is widely used in an array of supermarket goods, from cosmetics to bread, is a major cause of deforestation in many countries in south-east Asia. Attempts to encourage more sustainable production of palm oil have so far made little progress.Lawson said: “UK consumers don’t want to be associated with destroying orangutan habitat or human rights abuses overseas. The giant agricultural firms and supermarket chains involved in the trade in goods from Malaysia can easily absorb the tiny cost of ensuring this out of their own profits.”Current UK tariffs for Malaysian palm oil vary from 2% for crude palm oil to 12% for the more processed versions.","## Deforestation Concerns in UK Trade Deals

The UK government is facing criticism for a proposed policy that could undermine efforts to end deforestation overseas.

36," More Australians than ever are worried about the climate crisis, annual survey suggests","A record 75% of voters are worried about climate and 69% want the PM to push for net zero, but Queenslanders are less concerned than the rest of the nation

Get our free news app; get our morning email briefing
","A majority of Australians are worried about the threat posed by global heating and want serious action to address it, but Queenslanders are less concerned than people in other states, according to the latest Climate of the Nation report.The authoritative annual survey of 2,626 voters – now in its 14th year and managed by the progressive thinktank the Australia Institute – suggests three-quarters are worried about the climate crisis, the largest proportion in its history.As cabinet meets on Wednesday to consider a new climate roadmap the prime minister, Scott Morrison, wants to unveil before the Cop26 talks in Glasgow, the poll suggests a clear majority – 69% – want the Morrison government to put Australia on a path to net zero emissions. The same proportion wants the Coalition to do more to encourage the uptake of electric vehicles.US climate push on Australia and allies aims to ramp up pressure on China, ambassador saysRead moreBut the survey data suggests Queenslanders are less perturbed about the risks posed by the climate crisis than other Australians, with 69% saying they are concerned, compared with the national average of 75%.Queenslanders are also less likely to say Australia should be a world leader in looking for solutions than people in other states (63% of Queenslanders agree, compared with the national average of 67%).Morrison is attempting to persuade the National party to sign on to a net zero target before the United Nations-led climate conference in November. Liberals are optimistic agreement with the junior Coalition partner can be reached but a number of Queensland Nationals oppose the shift.While the Climate of the Nation data suggests attitudes in Queensland are different to other states, it also suggests public perceptions are on the move.Half the Queenslanders in the sample now support a moratorium on coalmining, which is a three-point increase from 2020. A significant majority also agrees that Australia needs environmental protections (71% agreed in 2021, up from 68% in 2020).Agreement among Queenslanders in the sample that coalmining has a strong economic future declined by eight points over the past 12 months (37% of respondents agree with that proposition now compared with 45% last year).But Australian voters continue to think fossil fuel industries employ more people and generate more national income than they actually do.The frenetic fan dance of the fools tells us the Coalition has reached crunch time on climate | Katharine MurphyRead moreWith trenchant opponents of climate action declaring Australia should not cripple traditional industries with ambitious emissions reduction targets – an attack line a number of Queensland Nationals use regularly – the latest survey shows Australians overestimate the size of gas industry employment by a factor of 46.Voters estimate that on average 9.2% of the workforce is engaged in oil and gas extraction when the reality is those industries represent only 0.2% of the Australian workforce.But a clear majority say they support the reliance on fossil fuels ending. The poll suggests 82% support the phasing out of coal-fired power stations.The Nationals leader, Barnaby Joyce, told the ABC on Tuesday night that a deal with the Liberals on net zero was not yet done.The deputy prime minister contended that regional Australians had been “done over” during previous international climate commitment periods because “people played a sneaky little game, and we ended up with the divestment of our private property”.Joyce said the Nationals wanted complete clarity on the economic assumptions guiding the shift Morrison was proposing.Climate 200 raises $2m in six weeks to help independents but expects Liberal party ‘interference’Read moreThe Nationals frontbenchers Bridget McKenzie, David Littleproud and Keith Pitt were briefed for the first time on Monday afternoon on the roadmap that has been worked up by the energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, with input from across the government. Joyce was in Monday’s briefing.Taylor was asked by Nationals to provide more detail about the economic analysis underpinning the new proposed roadmap for Wednesday’s cabinet deliberation. Some insiders insist the negotiation has a long way to go, and internal perceptions vary about the level of base support inside the Nationals for a climate policy pivot.The new Climate of the Nation survey will be launched on Wednesday by the shadow climate change minister, Chris Bowen. Bowen argues strong support for climate action in the data indicates “the needle has shifted in the public debate around climate change”.“It’s a global race to become a renewable energy superpower – it is clear Australians are on board – it’s past time for the government to join them,” Bowen said.The new survey and the cabinet deliberation comes as the Liberal senator Andrew Bragg will use a speech to the Investor Group on Climate Change to advocate for carbon neutrality by mid-century, declaring a “100% renewable energy future is within sight”.Bragg will argue schemes like Buy Now Pay Later have a role in driving the transition, and cite estimates showing that over the past year around 15% to 20% of all solar installations were financed by BNPL.

37, Australia’s mountain mist frog declared extinct as red list reveals scale of biodiversity crisis,"Experts describe it as a ‘beautiful endemic rainforest species’, one of several that have not been seen for decades

Marine life hit by ‘perfect storm’ as red list reveals species close to extinction
Get our morning and afternoon news emails, free app or daily news podcast
","The mountain mist frog, a species once found across two-thirds of Australia’s wet tropics, has been declared extinct on the International Union for Conservation of Nature red list.The last recorded sighting of the frog, most commonly found near Thornton Peak, north-west of Cairns, was in April 1990. It is believed to have been wiped out by chytrid fungus, a disease that attacks the skin and has destroyed amphibian populations across the globe, though a reduction in its natural habitat due to rising temperatures driven by greenhouse gas emissions may have also played a role.The species is listed as critically endangered by the Australian government, but was upgraded to extinct on the IUCN list. It was one of 26 Australian species to have its listing changed. Most of the others were types of orchid.Marine life hit by ‘perfect storm’ as red list reveals species close to extinctionRead moreDr Jodi Rowley, a frog biologist at the Australian Museum and the University of New South Wales, said the mountain mist frog was a “beautiful endemic rainforest species”, and one of several Australian frog species that had not been seen for decades but had not been declared extinct until now.“Many have dramatically declined and unfortunately this little guy seems to have disappeared,” Rowley said. “It is awfully sad. It has been searched for over the last 25 years so it is unlikely that it’s still out there.”

The mountain mist frog reached nearly 6cm in length and was described as grey, grey-brown or light brown, sometimes with black flecks or spots on its back.“For tens of thousands of years there were these little frogs that were calling their hearts out in these rainforests and now it’s silent,” she said. “We have a terrible track record on frog conservation in Australia.”But Rowley said it was important not to lose hope. There were about 40 frog species listed as threatened in Australian legislation and steps could be taken to help them, she said.There was also some positive news in the red list: the status of the Australasian bittern, a bird from the heron family, improved from endangered to vulnerable.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

39, Revealed: rightwing US lobbyists help craft slew of anti-protest fossil fuel bills,Legislation drafted by Alec part of backlash against Indigenous communities and environmentalists opposing oil and gas projects,"Republican-led legislatures have passed anti-protest laws drafted by an extreme-right corporate lobbying group in a third of all American states since 2018, as part of a backlash against Indigenous communities and environmentalists opposing fossil fuel projects, new research has found.The American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec) helped draft legislation criminalizing grassroots protests against pipelines, gas terminals and other oil and gas expansion projects in 24 states, under the guise of protecting critical infrastructure.Rightwing lobby group Alec driving laws to blacklist companies that boycott the oil industryRead moreAlec, which is funded by rightwing state lawmakers, corporate sponsors and trade groups, and wealthy ideologues, creates model legislation on a range of conservative issues such as gun control, abortion, education funding and environmental regulations.The laws were passed in 17 Republican-controlled states, including Oklahoma, North and South Dakota, Kansas, West Virginia and Indiana, where protesters now face up to 10 years in prison and million-dollar fines, according to a new report from the non-profit Climate Cabinet.The anti-protest bills, which were rolled out in response to the success of mostly Indigenous-led campaigns slowing down fossil-fuel infrastructure projects, have used intentionally vague language to create a chilling effect on free speech and assembly – both constitutionally protected rights, according to the report Critical Infrastructure Laws: A Threat to Protest & the Planet.“Indigenous-led demonstrations opposing fossil-fuel projects have been one of the most successful and effective forms of climate action to date … in an affront to the protected freedoms of our constitution, state legislatures have found a new legislative mechanism to oppress frontline communities and cause further harm and destruction to our planet,” said Jonathon Borja, co-author of the report.The first so-called critical infrastructure bills originated in Oklahoma in 2018, where the Republican state representative Scott Biggs referenced North Dakota’s Dakota Access pipeline (DAPL) protests and acknowledged that some anti-pipeline demonstrations had succeeded. “[The bill] is a preventative measure … to make sure that doesn’t happen here.”Other states followed after Alec created a model bill for lawmakers to copy. So far, the bills have not passed in any states where Democrats hold a majority in at least one legislative chamber, though some Democrats have voted in favor of them.In most of the bills, protesters, like those who participated in the DAPL demonstrations, could now face felony charges, while those charged with “aiding” protests could face harsh fines.Fossil fuel expansion projects halted by Indigenous-led campaigns represent the carbon equivalent of 12% of annual US and Canadian pollution, or 779m metric tons of greenhouse gases, according to data gathered by the Indigenous Environmental Network and Oil Change International.The report comes as the White House and Congress negotiate the final terms of a controversial permitting side deal with the Democratic West Virginia senator Joe Manchin, which could make it harder to legally challenge new pipelines and other fossil fuel infrastructure.In a statement Alec said: “Alec has long been a leader in promoting and protecting free speech … But protests can and do turn violent. And when they do, our critical infrastructure facilities must be protected.”","**Headline:** Anti-Protest Laws Threaten Free Speech

40, Insulate Britain protesters praised by judge who fined them,Judge says environmental activists ‘inspired me personally’ after impassioned speeches in court,"Insulate Britain protesters have been praised by a judge, who said he was “inspired” by their commitment to greener living, as he fined 12 of them over a demonstration that disrupted the journeys of drivers on the M25.The protesters blocked traffic at junction 3 of the motorway. Some glued themselves to the tarmac, while another glued himself to a police car.Nine of the activists admitted charges in relation to the protest either by post or in person at Crawley magistrates court on Tuesday.Mary Adams, 68, Ian Bates, 63, Karen Matthews, 60, Margurite Doubleday, 67, Bethany Mogie, 39, Xavier Gonzalez-Trimmer, 21, and Lucy Crawford, 52, each pleaded guilty to wilful obstruction of free passage of the highwayBiff Whipster, a 54-year-old from Canterbury, admitted criminal damage by leaving a “hard, crusty layer of glue” on the window of a police vehicle during the demonstration.Bates, Matthews and Whipster were told by Stephen Leake, the district judge, that they had “inspired” him after making impassioned speeches about their concerns over the climate while representing themselves in court.Leake said: “They have inspired me and personally I intend to do what I can to reduce my own impact on the planet, so to that extent your voices are certainly heard,” while adding: “I have heard your voices.”Despite saying their actions were inspiring, Leake added that his role was to “apply the law” and said their actions had caused “significant disruption” to the motorway. “These are difficult cases for us judges because we have to apply the law and that is what we have sworn our judicial oaths to do.”The court heard that the action caused disruption to an estimated 18,000 vehicles across the wider area, including an ambulance carrying a patient who “urgently needed to be transported”, according to evidence from National Highways.Protesters attending court on Monday, all of whom sat in the public gallery throughout the hearing, claimed they had exhausted all other means of campaigning over the climate crisis and resorted to “non-violent protest” to highlight their cause.Tissues were passed around by a member of court staff as several broke down in tears and held their faces in their hands while fellow activists voiced their fears over a “desperate” environmental situation.The judge said the protesters had “no doubt” been acting in a way they believed was “morally right” but had still committed a criminal offence.The 12 protesters received fines that ranged between £120 and £400.Another three protesters, Victoria Lindsell and Michelle Charlesworth, who were each accused of one count of wilful obstruction, and Louis McKechnie, who was charged with criminal damage, had their hearings adjourned until 28 April at Crawley magistrates court.","**Headline:** Insulate Britain Protesters Inspire Judge

41,‘Betting on a low-carbon future’: why China is ending foreign coal investment,Xi Jinping’s promise reflects growing awareness of the climate crisis in China and falling renewable prices,"The pledge by China’s president, Xi Jinping, on Tuesday to cease building new coal-fired power projects outside the country will be welcome news to environmentalists around the world. It came on the anniversary of Xi’s unilateral pledge for China to reach carbon neutrality by 2060. Last year Xi also promised that Chinese emissions would peak by 2030.“China will step up support for other developing countries in developing green and low-carbon energy, and will not build new coal-fired power projects abroad,” Xi said in a pre-recorded video address at the annual UN general assembly.Xi is personally invested in the climate agenda. Since he came to power in 2012, Beijing has been taking more visible steps in tackling its own environmental problems such as pollution. It has been extending its influence abroad, too, by joining international initiatives such as the 2015 Paris climate agreement – a pledge that Donald Trump pulled the US out of four years ago but which Joe Biden has rejoined. And unlike in some countries, there is consensus among China’s political elite that the climate crisis is real.‘What can we do?’ Chinese discuss role of climate crisis in deadly floodsRead moreInside China there has been growing awareness among citizens about the impact of the climate crisis. This summer’s devastating floods in Henan province illustrated to many people the consequences of inaction on the climate emergency. Jia Xiaolong, the deputy head of the national climate centre, told China News Agency that the heavy rainfall in Henan occurred “against the backdrop of global warming”.Xi’s announcement comes at a time when China’s relationship with western countries continues to deteriorate. Last week the US, the UK and Australia introduced a trilateral security partnership, nicknamed Aukus, which most analysts say has the aim of keeping China in check. In the meantime there have been questions over whether Xi will personally attend the Cop26 meeting in Glasgow in November.Sam Geall, the chief executive of China Dialogue, an environmental thinktank, said: “[Xi’s pledge at the UN] means China remains committed to climate action ahead of Cop26, even when geopolitical tensions are rising in other arenas – because China sees climate action as being in its national self-interest, in terms of technology leadership, political economy and, no doubt, soft power.“It also sends a message to the global south, that China is betting on a low-carbon future and China aims to be leading supplier and financier for developing countries of those clean technologies and infrastructures.”MapThere’s little doubt about how significant China’s promise to stop funding overseas coal-fired power projects is. Until recently, China, Japan and South Korea accounted for more than 95% of all foreign financing for coal-fired power plants, according to Georgetown University. Japan and South Korea promised to cease such operations early this year.China’s Lehman Brothers moment?: Evergrande crisis rattles economyRead moreBut the slew of promises from the trio in recent months is “low-hanging fruit”, according to Geall. The falling price of renewables in recent months means the economic case for coal is worse than ever. Few countries want to be lumbered with new coal fleets. “China will, of course, need to go further in curbing its domestic coal production and consumption – which it has room to do under its 14th five-year plan and as part of the 2060 goal,” he said.Dr Thomas Hale, of the University of Oxford’s Blavatnik School of Government, agreed. He said coal remained very much alive within China, which is the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter. After Xi’s pledge, all eyes would focus on China’s domestic plans. “Ultimately, the single most important question for the future of life on planet Earth is how quickly China can shut its thousands of coal facilities,” he said.But China’s historical reliance on coal is driven by the need to keep economic activity going. Ultimately, how China is to reduce its coal dependency will be determined by the transition of the economy itself. It is what Beijing has promised to do, but it is proving to be a difficult task. China’s provincial governments approved the construction of 24 new coal power projects in the first half of 2021, including three large-scale power plants, according to Greenpeace, although that represented a decline on numbers approved in 2020.While international commentaries have been heavily focused on the economic ramification of the potential collapse of Evergrande, China’s second largest property developer, in recent weeks, Hale thinks this crisis may ultimately be of more significance to the climate.“If that building crisis helps push the Chinese economy away from a debt-fuelled growth model, it could be the biggest climate development of the year. If instead it shows just how deeply that model is entrenched in China’s political economy, then we will need to treat China’s climate ambitions with greater scepticism,” he said.","**Headline:** China's Bold Climate Move

42,A&E for trees: pioneering clinic in India provides lifeline for poorly plants,An on-call team at Amritsar’s tree hospital nurses sick neems and gives new life to troubled banyans,"Sahib Singh clambers up a portable ladder, reaches out and, with the help of a few tools, tugs at the banyan tree and successfully removes it. The uprooted plant, which had sprouted from a wall inside the living room, is placed in a plastic bag filled with fertilised black soil. “We will replant this on the hospital lawn,” Singh says over Skype, while climbing back down the ladder. The operation lasts barely 20 minutes.The removal of the banyan tree, considered sacred in Hinduism, is the first of three calls attended by Singh in his tree ambulance on one day in May. He is a gardener and part of the team at the Pushpa Tree and Plant Hospital and Dispensary, in the northern Indian city of Amritsar, launched in January 2020.The hospital’s team of botanists, forestry experts, gardeners, volunteers and tree surgeons provide free services to people who need help protecting the city’s biodiversity. They replant uprooted trees, take care of the dying ones and ward off insect attacks from the fields. Sometimes, the trees are transplanted to more suitable locations.When our lives are endangered, ambulances ferry us to hospital. What about plants that are critical to our planet’s survival?Rohit Mehra“We provide about 33 kinds of plant-related services to people who call our helpline,” says Rohit Mehra, a civil servant and the brains behind the hospital. “When our lives are endangered, we have ambulances to ferry us to hospital, but what about plants that are so critical to our planet’s survival?”The hospital owns three tree ambulances – electric rickshaws that have been repurposed and stocked with gardening tools, a portable ladder and an array of plant medicines, fertilisers and growth tonics kept in neat plastic containers.Rohit Mehra, second from right, and his team with some of the lotions and potions administered to sickly trees in Amritsar. Photograph: HandoutRohit’s wife, Geetanjali Mehra, an environmentalist working with the hospital, says: “We use only organic and ayurvedic herbs to make medicines, pesticides and fertilisers to cure plant-related ailments like retarded growth, pest infestations and deformities.“We use herbs like neem, cinnamon bark, ashwagandha [Indian ginseng], moringa [drumstick powder], as well as fruit and vegetable peels to make our medicines. Neem oil mixed with water in a 70-30 ratio makes for an excellent insecticide, as well as a tonic for plants.”The hospital also refers to ancient textbooks such as the Vriksha Ayurveda, Panchratna and Vastu Shastra, which include recipes for plant medicines, and has compiled a manual on plant care. “Termite attacks are addressed by filling a mud pot with jaggery and burying it in the fields after covering its lid. After 15 days, all the insects find their way into the pot and the field becomes termite free. You simply have to remove the pot,” says Geetanjali.Volunteer Ram Sevak loads up one of the hospital’s three rickshaws repurposed as ‘tree ambulances’. Photograph: Neeta Lal/HandoutCalls to the helpline are registered and attended to by the ambulance team, which includes a gardener, volunteer and biodiversity expert. For larger operations, more people are called into service. Three to four calls in neighbouring areas are answered in a day.Singh’s next stop is at the home of a resident with a cluster of neem trees which appear to be dying. Singh begins by carefully inspecting each tree. He then scratches their gnarly bark to take a closer look before bending down to examine the soil below.After 15 minutes, the problem is diagnosed. “The trees have been poisoned,” Singh announces gravely. He summons his assistant to dig up the earth around the trees and remove it. Ten sacks of fresh soil mixed with herbs and fertilisers are brought in from the ambulance and poured around the trees. “The trees will be fine in a fortnight,” Singh says.

Within 15 minutes, three men arrive and, after a 90-minute struggle, the job is accomplished; Singh and his assistant manage to bed the tree firmly in the soil with the help of shovels and spades.

43, UK startup Octopus Energy becomes renewable energy giant in £3bn deal ,Plan to create 50 million customers after takeover of Octopus Renewables hands UK supplier 300 projects in six countries ,"The UK’s fastest growing energy supplier will soon become one of Europe’s biggest renewable energy investors in a deal worth more than £3bn, which could bring green energy to 50 million homes in six years.Octopus Energy will snap up its sister company Octopus Renewables in a move that will hand the startup a portfolio of about 300 renewable energy projects, across six different countries, enough to power more than 1.2 million homes.The fast-growing energy supplier hopes to grow its international business to create 50 million Octopus Energy customers by 2027, and plans to increase its new renewables division to generate as much clean electricity as it sells.Octopus Energy last year achieved double “unicorn status” – a term used to describe young startup companies worth at least $1bn –after investors valued the company at more than $2bn, just five years after it began supplying gas and electricity.Greg Jackson, the founder and chief executive of Octopus Energy, said the deal would create a business that was “unrivalled on the global stage” by combining the supplier’s unique technology platform with the investment expertise of Octopus Renewables. He said the deal could “change the entire energy lifecycle, make every green electron matter, and deliver the green energy transition faster and cheaper for everyone”.Boris Johnson visiting the Octopus Energy headquarters in London in October. Photograph: Leon Neal/APJackson, who owns a 7.4% stake in Octopus Energy, amassed a paper fortune of an estimated $155m (£115m) after the company’s £2bn valuation last year, making him one of the most successful green energy entrepreneurs in UK corporate history.Chris Hulatt, the co-founder of Octopus Group, which owns both companies, said there was “a huge opportunity” to “unleash pent-up capital that can help deliver the green energy transition faster than anyone ever imagined”.Octopus Renewables was founded 21 years ago and owns a string of wind and solar projects in the UK, including several rooftop solar assets in Manchester and Birmingham and windfarms in South Lanarkshire and Northamptonshire. Earlier this month Nest, the UK’s largest workplace pension scheme, which manages pensions for more than 10 million employees, chose Octopus Renewables to help invest an initial sum of £250m directly into onshore wind and solar energy projects after divesting from fossil fuels.Octopus Energy’s ambition to increase its customer base to 50 million homes globally, includes a plan to reach another 50 million homes through its bespoke software platform which it leases to other suppliers to help run their energy supply businesses.Octopus has struck deals with big utility companies in Australia and Japan to use the “elect-tech” software, which uses bespoke algorithms to make it easier to offer customers “smart” renewable energy tariffs that can integrate home batteries and electric vehicles to make using renewable power cheaper.The technology platform is already used in 17 million homes, including customers of E.ON and Good Energy which lease the technology to run their own businesses. Octopus Energy has also made inroads into the German and US markets.","**Headline:** Octopus Energy: A Renewable Energy Giant

44,LettersTurn out the lights to save our moths,"Artificial light is endangering Britain’s moths, but reducing the risk is as easy as flicking a switch, writes Anna Levin","Your article on the decline in Britain’s moths (Britain’s moths decline by a third in 50 years, study finds, 3 March) mentions light pollution as “possibly” an important factor. This risks underplaying the impact of artificial light on every stage of a moth’s life and every aspect of its world. Light is time in the natural world and the vital synchronising of migration, pollination, predation and reproduction all depend on the pattern of light and dark.While the report mentioned in your article says that as yet there is limited evidence of direct causation between artificial light at night and population changes in moths, it also says that there are direct effects throughout their life cycle. Light pollution disrupts moths’ hormones, breeding, navigation and feeding. It also increases risk of predation by bats, and affects the availability of their plant food sources.Of all the potential causes of moth decline, from intensive agriculture to climate change, light pollution is the simplest to address: switch the lights off!

45," Chemical pollution killing off England’s riverflies, experts warn",Fears for river ecosystems as average number of species declines,"Chemical pollution is killing off the invertebrate species that are the basis of England’s river ecosystems, with experts raising the alarm over falling diversity of mayfly, caddisfly and stonefly species.A census of aquatic wildlife on 12 English rivers found that in the spring and summer 2021, the mean number of riverfly species detected had fallen. In autumn last year, an average of just 10 species were recorded in each sample, compared with 13 in 2016.The findings come as the government considers a new “chemicals strategy” to reduce chemical pollution as part of its 25-year environment plan. Green groups are calling on ministers to take a dozen key steps they say could ameliorate contamination – but particularly to tackle chemicals from agriculture.Stephanie Morren, the senior policy officer at the RSPB, said: “It is not acceptable that the pressure on rivers from chemical pollution is getting worse and impacting wildlife.“We are living in a nature crisis, and we urgently need [the] government to take action. Given that such a significant amount of water pollution is from agricultural sources, it is vital that farmers are supported to reduce their reliance on inputs such as pesticides.”Sarah Haynes, coordinator at the Pesticide Collaboration, said: “It often takes decades to realise the true harm of pesticides and other chemicals on our environment. Once the damage is done and a pesticide gets banned, a new chemical will enter the market … and so it goes. Enough is enough. As the movement for nature-friendly farming swells, the government needs a proper plan to reduce pesticide use and help revive our rivers.”Hail Mary! Statue’s trip down the Wye raises chicken pollution issueRead moreIn the UK, more than 4,100 invertebrate species spend at least part of their lifecycle in freshwater. “Riverflies play many vital roles in our freshwater environment. They help to break down and filter organic matter and provide a food source for fish, birds, and mammals. Their presence is the standard indicator of the health of the habitat they live in,” Craig Macadam, the conservation director at Buglife, said.Exposure to chemical pollutants causes a range of problems for these invertebrate communities, leading from arrested development all the way to death. The different tolerances of the various aquatic invertebrates can allow scientists to determine the scale of the chemical impact at a particular site.“Looking at this data has allowed us to determine if, and how, chemicals are impacting aquatic wildlife, and whether the problem is getting better or worse,” researchers said in a report published on Tuesday.The report used Species at Risk scores – which are calculated from the diversity and abundance of invertebrates present in a river – generated from the riverfly census.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In fact, Rachel Carson warned us of its threat in her book Silent Spring in 1962.“The results of the chemical report show that invertebrate communities are more stressed now than they were in our previous study, indicating the problem is getting worse.

46, Texas oil company charged in massive spill off southern California coast,Prosecutors say company repeatedly failed to act on alarms that alerted workers to pipeline rupture ,"A Houston-based oil company and two subsidiaries have been charged over a massive oil spill off the coast of southern California in October that fouled waters and beaches and endangered wildlife.Prosecutors say the spill was caused in part by failing to properly act when alarms repeatedly alerted workers to a pipeline rupture.Amplify Energy and its companies that operate several oil rigs and a pipeline off Long Beach were charged by a federal grand jury with a single misdemeanor count of illegally discharging oil.Investigators believe the pipeline was weakened when a cargo ship’s anchor snagged it in high winds in January, months before it ultimately ruptured on 1 October, spilling up to 25,000 gallons (94,600 liters) of crude oil in the ocean.US prosecutors said the companies were negligent six ways, including failing to respond to eight leak detection system alarms over a 13-hour period that should have alerted them to the spill and would have minimized the damage. Instead, the pipeline was shut down after each alarm and then restarted, spewing more oil into the ocean.Amplify blamed the unnamed shipping company for displacing the pipeline and said workers on and offshore responded to what they believed were false alarms because the system wasn’t functioning properly. It was signaling a potential leak at the platform where no leak was occurring, the company said.The leak, in fact, was from a section of undersea pipe 4 miles (6.4km) away, Amplify said.“Had the crew known there was an actual oil spill in the water, they would have shut down the pipeline immediately,” the company said.Workers in protective suits clean the contaminated beach in Corona Del Mar after an oil spill off the southern California coast, on 7 October 2021. Photograph: Ringo HW Chiu/APThe spill came ashore at Huntington Beach and forced about a weeklong closure of the city’s beaches and others along the Orange county coast. Fishing in the affected area resumed only recently, after testing confirmed fish did not have unsafe levels of oil toxins. It also seeped into delicate wetlands that are critical habitats for migratory and shorebirds, and other endangered species. It is still unclear how much of a lasting impact the spill had on plants and animals, even after the black globs were cleared from the beaches.‘It is there pretty much forever’: Huntington Beach oil spill may permanently affect birdsRead moreIf convicted, the charge carries up to five years of probation for the corporation and fines that could total millions of dollars. Orange county supervisor Katrina Foley said the indictment validates residents who had detected the spill a day earlier and reported it.“It’s terrible that they basically lied to the community during the press briefings and caused people to believe that what they saw with their own eyes or smelled or knew was actually not true,” she said.Pipeline safety advocate Bill Caram said the indictment paints a picture of a reckless company.“I understand there are false positives on leak detection systems but this is our treasured coastline,” said Caram, director of the Bellingham, Washington-based Pipeline Safety Trust. “The fact that they kept hitting the snooze button and ignoring alarms, stopping and starting this pipeline and all the while leaking oil in the Pacific Ocean is reckless and egregious.”Prosecutors also found that the pipeline was understaffed and the crew was fatigued and insufficiently trained in the leak detection system.The indictment’s description of company personnel as fatigued pointed to a long-standing industry problem, said pipeline expert Ramanan Krishnamoorti with the University of Houston.“Fatigue and overworked staff is old and trite and inexcusable,” he said. “This has been demonstrated over and over again as being the single most important vulnerability.”","**Headline:** Oil Spill Charges Filed Against Texas Company

47,Country diary: So much life is here when I am not,"Abernethy Forest, Cairngorms: My daytime walk through the woods is rich with crested tits and busy ants; by night the clientele changes entirely","I’m walking through the woods to a huge old granny pine that’s gnarled and twisted, its lower branches thicker than the old plantation pines around it. It’s a beautiful, steady presence. The woods feel lush and full of birdsong. Thick strands of new-growth heather poke up. In the afternoon sunshine the mosses glow and creep up and along the trees. There’s a lovely old Scots phrase, moss fa’en, to describe a fallen tree that’s now shrouded in green.Near the granny lies a deep chocolatey-brown peaty mire that often has hoof prints in it, and I’ve had a camera on it just to see what is there when I am not. It’s clear that deer visit this place quite regularly, sometimes singly but often in groups, and use it as a wallow. At night, they’re sometimes reduced to the vaguest of shadows, and mostly they’re quietly passing by and the camera captures the bright dots of their eyes as they cross the frame. Occasionally their eyes gleam like headlights as they face the camera. They might be in groups of seven or eight, perhaps more, and they’ll linger and tussle, hoof and splash around.‘Occasionally their eyes gleam like headlights as they face the camera.’ Photograph: Amanda ThomsonSometimes it looks like just hinds, at other times, perhaps at certain times of year, mixed groups, and the camera’s caught a huge stag wading into the middle of the mire and rolling around. More than once a badger has snuffled in the mosses and heather at the base of the pine where the camera was mounted, and I’ve caught a beady eye and the blurry stripe of its snout. The last time I was here I moved the camera to a new spot. When I check, I find that it’s caught a pine marten scrambling down a broken branch that hangs from tree to ground.I walk on, coming across a massive ants’ nest next to another granny pine. Ants are streaming up and down, making light work of navigating the thick scales, fissures and flecks of the bark. Somewhere above I hear a crestie (crested tit) with its soft call, almost a giggle. It’s always the way, I come for one thing, then am distracted by everything else going on. I swap the SD card and leave my camera there, wondering what it will capture next.

48, Electricity needed to mine bitcoin is more than used by 'entire countries',Bitcoin mining – the process in which a bitcoin is awarded to a computer that solves a complex series of algorithm – is a deeply energy intensive process,"It’s not just the value of bitcoin that has soared in the last year – so has the huge amount of energy it consumes.The cryptocurrency’s value has dipped recently after passing a high of $50,000 but the energy used to create it has continued to soar during its epic rise, climbing to the equivalent to the annual carbon footprint of Argentina, according to Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, a tool from researchers at Cambridge University that measures the currency’s energy use.Recent interest from major Wall Street institutions like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs probably culminated in the currency’s rise in value and an endorsement by Tesla’s Elon Musk helped drive its recent high as investors bet the cryptocurrency will become more widely embraced in the near future.interactiveWhile the recent fall has dented Musk’s fortune, bitcoin also poses a threat to the company’s mission toward a “zero-emission future” and poses serious questions for governments and corporations looking to curb their own carbon footprints.Bitcoin mining – the process in which a bitcoin is awarded to a computer that solves a complex series of algorithms – is a deeply energy-intensive process.“Mining” bitcoin involves solving complex math problems in order to create new bitcoins. Miners are rewarded in bitcoin.Earlier in bitcoin’s relatively short history – the currency was created in 2009 – one could mine bitcoin on an average computer. But the way bitcoin mining has been set up by its creator (or creators – no one really knows for sure who created it) is that there is a finite number of bitcoins that can be mined: 21m. The more bitcoin that is mined, the harder the algorithms that must be solved to get a bitcoin become.Now that over 18.5m bitcoin have been mined, the average computer can no longer mine bitcoins. Instead, mining now requires special computer equipment that can handle the intense processing power needed to get bitcoin today. And, of course, these special computers need a lot of electricity to run.The amount of electricity used to mine bitcoin “has historically been more than [electricity used by] entire countries, like Ireland”, said Benjamin Jones, a professor of economics at the University of New Mexico who has researched bitcoin’s environmental impact. “We’re talking about multiple terawatts, dozens of terawatts a year of electricity being used just for bitcoin … That’s a lot of electricity.”Proponents of bitcoin say that mining is increasingly being done with electricity from renewable sources as that type of energy becomes cheaper, and the energy used is far lower than that of other, more wasteful, uses of power. The energy wasted by plugged-in but inactive home devices in the US alone could power bitcoin mining for 1.8 years, according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index.But environmentalists say that mining is still a cause for concern particularly because miners will go wherever electricity is cheapest and that may mean places that use coal. According to Cambridge, China has the most bitcoin mining of any country by far. While the country has been slowly moving toward renewable energy, about two-thirds of its electricity comes from coal.Since there is no government body or organization that officially tracks where bitcoin is being mined and what type of electricity miners are using, there is no way of knowing whether miners are using electricity that is fueled by renewable energy or fossil fuels.Mining rigs can move from place to place depending on where energy is cheapest, which makes mining particularly hard to track.“The places where you mine [bitcoin] can be moved around and, in some cases, you don’t even know where they are,” said Camilo Mora, a professor of geography and environment at the University of Hawaii.Cambridge’s Centre for Alternative Finances estimates that bitcoin’s annualised electricity consumption hovers just above 115 terawatt-hours (TWh) while Digiconomist’s closely tracked index puts it closer to 80 TWh.A single transaction of bitcoin has the same carbon footprint as 680,000 Visa transactions or 51,210 hours of watching YouTube, according to the site.A paper from 2018 from the Oak Ridge Institute in Ohio found that one dollar’s worth of bitcoin took 17 megajoules of energy, more than double the amount of energy it took to mine one dollar’s worth of copper, gold and platinum. Another study from the UK published last year said that computer power required to mine Bitcoin quadrupled in 2019 compared with the year before, and that mining has had an influence in prices in some power and utility markets.Bitcoin’s advocates have made it clear that they believe any environmental costs that come with mining bitcoin are worth the broader impacts it could have on society.00:05:59Why Bitcoin is so bad for the planet – video explainer“Bitcoin would not be able to fulfill its role as a secure, global value transfer and storage system without being costly to maintain,” reads a defense against bitcoin criticism from Ria Bhutoria, director of research at Fidelity Digital Assets.“Computers and smartphones have much larger carbon footprints than typewriters and telegraphs. Sometimes a technology is so revolutionary and important for humanity that society accepts the tradeoffs,” wrote investor Tyler Winklevoss on Twitter.Some have pointed out that there does not have to be a tradeoff between cryptocurrency and the environment. The creators of ethereum, considered the second most popular type of cryptocurrency after bitcoin, have promised to change the currency’s algorithm to make its mining more environmentally friendly.Vitalik Buterin, the computer scientist who invited ethereum, told IEEE Spectrum that mining cryptocurrency can be “a huge waste of resources, even if you don’t believe that pollution and carbon dioxide are an issue”, Buterin said. “There are real consumers – real people – whose need for electricity is being displaced by this stuff.”Currently, ethereum’s mining works similarly to bitcoin where the most powerful computers have an edge in getting the most bitcoin as computers compete to complete a transaction first. Ethereum’s developers are working on changing that system so that miners enter a pool and are randomly selected to complete the transaction and receive an ether in return. This method, called “proof-of-stake”, guarantees that less electricity will be used to mine the currency.But with bitcoin still reigning as the top cryptocurrency and, with endorsements from established companies and investment banks, the currency’s environmental impact is only likely to grow.When it comes to electricity, “the computer doesn’t care. The computer is just getting the electricity to run, but where its electricity comes from makes a huge difference [for the environment],” said Mora.","# Bitcoin Energy Consumption: A Global Concern

49," The climate crisis requires a new culture and politics, not just new techPeter Sutoris",This moment calls for humility – we cannot innovate ourselves out of this mess,"We are living through what scientists call the Anthropocene, a new geological age during which humans have become the dominant force shaping the natural environment. Many scientists date this new period to the post-second world war economic boom, the “great acceleration”. This rapid increase in our control over the Earth has brought us to the precipice of catastrophic climate change, triggered a mass extinction, disrupted our planet’s nitrogen cycles and acidified its oceans, among other things.Our society has come to believe that technology is the solution. Electricity from renewable sources, energy-efficient buildings, electric vehicles and hydrogen fuels are among the many innovations that we hope will play a decisive role in reducing emissions. Most of the mainstream climate-change models now assume some degree of “negative emissions” in the future, relying on large-scale carbon capture technology, despite the fact that it is far from ready to be implemented. And if all else fails, the story goes, we can geoengineer the Earth.But the problem with this narrative is that it focuses on the symptoms, not the causes of environmental decay. Even if the technologies on which we pin our hopes for the future deliver as expected and do not lead to much collateral damage – both of which are huge assumptions – they will not have fixed our mindsets. This is a crisis of culture and politics, not of science and technology. To believe that we can innovate and engineer ourselves out of this mess is to miss the key lesson of the Anthropocene – that dealing with planetary-scale processes calls for humility, not arrogance.Our civilisation is underpinned by extractivism, a belief that the Earth is ours to exploit, and the nonsensical idea of infinite growth within a finite territory. Material possessions as markers of achievement, a drive to consume for the sake of consumption, and blindness to the long-term consequences of our actions, have all become part of the culture of global capitalism. But there is nothing self-evident about these things, as indigenous peoples teach us.Many indigenous groups got to know their natural environments intimately and sustained themselves over millennia, often despite harsh conditions. They came to understand the limits of what these environments could support, and they grasped that caring for the environment was simultaneously an act of self-care. Pacific islanders would designate no-go areas of the ocean to avoid overfishing, while high-altitude farmers in the Andes would rely on terraces that reduced erosion to grow their crops. It is not a coincidence that as much as 80% of the world’s remaining biodiversity is located within territories inhabited by indigenous peoples.How we talk about the climate crisis is increasingly crucial to tackling it | Susanna RustinRead moreRebuilding our relationship with our planet does not mean abandoning the many achievements of our civilisation. Some of our technological innovations can help us treat the symptoms of the environmental multi-crisis. But addressing the causes means abandoning some of the assumptions on which our current society is built: infinite growth, the instrumentalisation of the natural environment and speciesism.What does this look like in practice? Changing the collective mindset of a civilisation calls for a shift in values. It means educating our children about humility and connectedness, rather than vanity and individuality. It means changing our relationship with consumption, breaking the spell of advertising, manufactured needs and status. It means political organising, generating demand for a politics that sees beyond the nation state, and beyond the lifespan of the currently living generations – Wales has already started, with its Wellbeing of Future Generations Act.The Covid-19 pandemic has shown just how fragile and myopic our civilisation is. While technology has played a huge role in finding a way out of the pandemic through the development of vaccines, it has also highlighted humanity’s limitations as our societies became paralysed in the face of forces of nature more powerful than ourselves. And our chaotic response showed that technological prowess is no substitute for good political leadership. We must face up to the harsh reality that for all its achievements, our civilisation is deeply flawed. It will take a reimagination of who we are to truly solve this crisis.

50," Ban European flights and car use in cities to hurt Putin, report urges","Strong measures by Europe could quickly deprive Russia of oil and gas income worth billions, experts say

Russia-Ukraine war: latest updates
","Flights should be banned in continental Europe and car use banned in city centres to save energy and prevent Vladimir Putin profiting from fossil fuel sales, campaigners have said.It would be possible for Europe to quickly end its reliance on oil and gas from Russia by taking strong measures, according to a report by the climate adviser Mark Lynas, energy analyst Rauli Partanen, and energy and sustainability installations specialist Joris van Dorp.Policies include rationing, with everyone in Europe allowed the same minimum amount of energy to use, and limiting thermostats to 18C in winter.“The biggest problem is gas. In total last year Europe imported 155 billion cubic metres of gas from Russia,” the authors said. Critics of the EU’s oil and gas policy have pointed out that hydrocarbon sales are financing the war in Ukraine.Even the EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said recently: “We’ve given Ukraine nearly €1bn. That might seem like a lot but €1bn is what we’re paying Putin every day for the energy he provides us with. Since the start of the war, we’ve given him €35bn [£29bn], compared to the €1bn we’ve given Ukraine to arm itself.”00:00:49€1bn for Ukraine, €35bn for Russia: top EU diplomat calls out funding gap – videoThe report’s authors said: “We conclude it is possible to eliminate Russian gas imports starting immediately in Europe. This will require an unprecedented level of European solidarity, a combination of a Marshall plan and a Berlin airlift to redistribute energy around the continent as needed and support the transition.”The International Energy Agency recently released a 10-point plan to reduce demand for oil use in member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, with suggestions including subsidised public transport, lower speed limits and a reduction in business flights. The authors of the latest report from the RePlanet Research Institute, however, say such measures would reduce demand by 2.7m barrels a day in advanced economies, still substantially less than Russian oil exports to Europe.Buying Russian gas and oil has funded Putin’s war, says top EU officialRead moreThe authors argue that we need to go further, and say they have worked out how to eliminate 25% of all oil use in Europe.“We propose bans on all business flights, private jets and internal flights within Europe to save oil, and bans also on car use within cities,” they said. “This should be combined with free public transport. While the impacts of this are not easily quantified, we believe this could double the reduction in oil use beyond that proposed by the IEA.”To replace the gas Europe buys from Russia, the authors recommend measures including stopping the nuclear phaseout in Germany, Sweden and Belgium, reducing heating in buildings by 4C, and a fast-track deployment of additional solar and wind generation.These policies could be popular in Europe. New polling conducted by Savanta ComRes found that 41% of people polled in the UK, Germany Poland, France, Sweden and the Netherlands said they “strongly agreed” that their country should immediately stop buying Russian oil and gas. Only 6.4% strongly disagreed.Just over 40% said they would be prepared to accept energy rationing to manage demand, and 52.7% that they would eat less meat to reduce demand on Ukrainian exports.“Europe is sending over €500m every day directly to the Kremlin because we continue to import vast quantities of Russian oil, gas and coal. This situation cannot continue,” the authors of the report said.“It is morally and politically untenable for Europe to fund Putin’s war machine – paying for the same missiles and bombs that are raining down on Ukrainian schools and hospitals – at the same time as supposedly uniting to stop Putin through sanctions. There is only one solution. We must cut off this torrent of money we are sending to the Kremlin by immediately stopping our imports of Russian fossil fuels.”","**Headline:** Energy Independence for Europe

","The world’s largest sand island formed around a million years ago and enabled the southern and central Great Barrier Reef to develop, new research suggests.An international team of scientists have dated K’gari (Fraser Island) and the nearby Cooloola Sand Mass in south-east Queensland as forming between 0.7m and 1.2m years ago.‘Fraser Island’ to be dropped in favour of Indigenous name K’gari under Queensland proposalRead moreTheir formation was “a necessary precondition for initiation of the southern and central Great Barrier Reef”, the researchers found.In geological terms, the world’s largest reef system developed relatively recently – an estimated 450,000 to 670,000 years ago.The study’s authors described this timing as a “conundrum”, because climatic conditions along the central and southern Queensland coastline have been ideal for reef growth since much earlier – between 2.6m years and 5.3m years ago, during the Pliocene epoch.Study co-author Prof Patrick Moss, head of the school of earth and environmental sciences at the University of Queensland, said there were two main theories for the formation of the Great Barrier Reef.

The first is temperature – “that basically from around 500,000 … [to] 700,000 years ago, there was a 4C increase in sea surface temperatures which allowed reef growth to occur,” Moss said.The second theory, which the K’gari study supports, is that clear waters were necessary.“Before K’gari and the other giant sand masses were formed, you had a lot more sand transport further north, and so that would produce murkier water and limit reef growth at that time,” Moss said.K’gari, a Unesco world heritage site, is the world’s largest sand island and also the end point of one of the world’s longest “longshore drift” coastal systems. Sand from the island originates as far as central New South Wales, travelling 1,500km north along the east coast of Australia.“The longshore drift process picks up sand grains and transports them to K’gari and along the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast,” Moss said. “That’s a really important aspect of creating south-east Queensland environment.”K’gari and the dune fields acted as a barrier to this longshore drift process, enabling reef growth, the study’s authors suggest.The researchers dated the age of the dunes on K’gari using two techniques: optically stimulated luminescence and palaeomagnetic dating.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

52,AnalysisWeather tracker: Anchorage on course for its snowiest November everLauren Herdman and Morgan Thomas (Metdesk),"Alaska’s largest city breaks several daily snowfall records, with snowstorms prompting state of emergency","Parts of Alaska have experienced considerable snowfall this autumn, with the state’s largest city on track to surpass its November record by some margin.The city of Anchorage, which typically receives about 5 inches (12cm) of snow during the first two weeks of November, has so far had an impressive 37.9 inches. Several daily records have been broken, most starkly on 8 November, with 9 inches of snow within 24 hours. That was part of a larger three-day snowstorm that brought more than 20 inches in total. A state of emergency was declared in the city during this event, prompting the closure of schools, suspension of public transport, and increased efforts to find shelter for the homeless population, with four deaths reported among people living outdoors.With half the month still to go and another large snowfall event forecast for early next week, Anchorage’s record for November – 38.8 inches in 1994 – is expected to topple. November 2023 will end as one of Anchorage’s snowiest months of all time, with the top spot held by February 1996, which saw 52.1 inches. Anchorage typically receives about 77 inches for winter as a whole, with the all-time record of 134.5 inches set during the winter season of 2011-12.In the South Pacific, Fiji was affected by Severe Tropical Cyclone Mal this week, which passed to the south-west of the islands on Wednesday and Thursday. The cyclone was equivalent in strength to a category 1 hurricane, with gusts of almost 100mph near the centre of the storm. Fiji closed many schools, and some homes were evacuated, but despite strong winds and heavy rainfall, the storm passed by with enough distance to prevent significant damage. Mal then continued southward, weakening to an extra tropical cyclone.Another tropical cyclone is expected to develop on Friday, this time in the Bay of Bengal. At the time of writing, the tropical depression was moving northwards towards Bangladesh, and was expected to intensify into a tropical cyclone before making landfall on Friday. If the storm does reach cyclone status, it will be called Midhili, a name proposed by the Maldives. The expected cyclone is forecast to produce 50-60mph gusts, with 100-150mm of rainfall possible for south-western parts of Bangladesh.","**Headline**: Alaska's Largest City Breaking Records with Snowfall

53, This article is more than 3 months oldMore aid money spent on clean air than fossil fuels for first timeThis article is more than 3 months old,"Clean Air Fund says despite increased spending on air pollution, projects still receive less than 1% of funding","Governments, agencies and development banks have spent more aid money on clean air than fossil fuels for the first time on record, a report has found.However, such projects still receive less than 1% of international development funding, according to the Clean Air Fund, an environmental charity.Toxic particles in the air are the fourth-biggest killer globally, but campaigners say efforts to get rid of them have been “chronically” starved of cash. Only blood pressure, smoking and diet play a bigger role in whether people die too early.Jane Burston, the executive director of the Clean Air Fund, said cleaning the air saves lives, grows economies and slows the climate crisis, adding: “It’s the single thing that has the biggest bang for your buck if you fund it.”The report found that international aid for fossil fuels peaked in 2019 and has fallen fast but still lingers. In 2021, about $1.5bn (£1.2bn) was spent on fossil fuel projects like building coal plants or gas pipelines, down from $11.9bn two years earlier. The amount spent on tackling outdoor air pollution has risen to $2.3bn.Despite this shift, spending targeted at clean air made up just 1% of international development funding and 2% of international public climate finance between 2015 and 2021, the report found.“The trend is good but the funding is increasing from a very low base,” said Burston. “It’s not increasing quickly enough,” she added.Nor has the money been spent in the places that need it most, the report found. Africa received 5% of air quality funding between 2017 and 2021, despite being home to five of the 10 countries with the highest levels of air pollution in the world. At the same time, five polluted Asian countries – China, the Philippines, Bangladesh, Mongolia and Pakistan – received 86% of the funding.Scientists are unsure just how many people are killed by dirty air each year but estimates of the death toll run into the millions just from air pollution caused by burning fossil fuels. Fertiliser from farms, road dust from car tyres and natural factors all add to the mortality burden.Outdoor air pollution, which was the focus of the Clean Air Fund report, caused 4.2m premature deaths in 2019, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).Most of the deaths happen in poor and middle-income countries. In countries across Africa and Asia, in which large parts of the population lack access to electricity, governments have struggled to afford clean sources of energy that are cheaper to run than fossil fuel plants but cost more upfront.Some countries have taken big steps to clean up their air. China declared a “war against pollution” in 2014 and has brought levels of fine particulates down 40% in a decade. As a result, residents of Beijing can expect to live four years longer on average, according to a report from the Air Quality Life Index of the University of Chicago in August.People in rich countries are also choking on dangerous levels of toxic pollutants. An investigation by the Guardian last week found 98% of people in Europe are breathing air clogged with so many pollutants it breaches WHO guidelines.Zorana Jovanovic Andersen, an epidemiologist at the University of Copenhagen and the chair of the environment committee at the European Respiratory Society, said: “The cost of inaction on air pollution to our health and our societies and economies is already too high and unacceptable. It is time to shift these costs from people and the health sector to those who produce pollution.”","**Headline:** Clean Air, Healthier Future

54,  100m highly polluting cars could appear on Europe’s roads after EU move,Exclusive: Efficiency recommendations of experts rejected in European Commission ‘Euro 7’ proposals,"Almost 100m highly polluting cars could appear on Europe’s roads over the next decade after the European Commission moved to disown its own experts efficiency recommendations in a leaked proposal seen by the Guardian.About 70,000 premature deaths in 2018 were caused by road transport emissions, mostly nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM), and the commission had been expected to tighten pollution limits in the next “Euro 7” regulation, which takes effect in 2025.A “medium ambition” option which would save €136bn (£119bn) in net health and environmental costs was touted, based on recommendations by an EU consortium of experts called Clove.However, the draft Euro 7 regulation only proposes bringing diesel emissions into line with those for petrol cars in the existing Euro 6 law, while petrol standards would remain unchanged.Anna Krajinska, the vehicle emissions and air quality manager for the Transport & Environment (T&E) campaign group said that the commission had reached its “very own Dieselgate moment”.“The tearing up of its own expert group advice is a scandal and completely undermines the tightening of pollution standards for cars and vans,” she said. “The auto industry lobby has fiercely opposed Euro 7, using a variety of dirty tricks to influence decision-makers. Now the commission has caved into their demands. Carmakers’ profits are being prioritised over the health of millions of Europeans.”The auto industry lobbied the commission intensely in the run up to the draft regulation, with one Volkswagen official last year painting “a picture of horror” to EU officials of the effect that tough standards could have, according to Der Spiegel.“Women would have to be afraid [when] in dark garages in the future; accident victims would have to wait, trembling, for the ambulance; police officers might arrive too late at the scene of the crime. And all this, because cars would have to warm up their exhaust gas purification systems before they could be allowed to start … ” the German newspaper reported.A spokesperson for the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association said: “The industry is calling for an approach that is not only effective in terms of results, but that is cost-beneficial, while also addressing the huge challenges of meeting future CO2 targets. Vehicle manufacturers are going full-course ahead with the goal of carbon neutrality – it would be counter-productive to take away investments from this.”The Euro 7 emissions standard, due to be published on 9 November, had been planned for four years as a replacement to the Euro 6, which was set in 2014, before the Dieselgate scandal.Under the anticipated medium ambition option, NOx emission limits would have been cut from 60 to 30mg a km, with particulate matter limits falling from 4.5 to 2mg/km, based on new emissions technologies.The draft regulation, which is being considered by commissioners and could change, says that this option was proportionate, cost-efficient and “the most effective” for cutting air pollution.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Particulate matter emissions have also fallen by 28% for cars and vans, and 14% for lorries and buses.","**Headline:** Protect Our Health, Not Car Profits

55, Liz Truss appoints green Tory Chris Skidmore to lead net zero review,Former energy and climate minister will look for the quickest ways to reach the emissions target,"Liz Truss has appointed the Conservative MP Chris Skidmore to lead a review of net zero, to find the most efficient and fastest ways to reach the climate target.The former energy and climate minister has been given until the end of the year to present his findings to the prime minister.Skidmore, who chairs the environment all-party parliamentary group, has been campaigning for his party to take the issue of net zero more seriously. He said: “I am delighted to have been invited by the PM to conduct the review. It’s essential government delivers net zero, and does so in a way that is pro-business and pro-growth. I’m looking forward to getting started.”He told the Guardian during his tour of north-west England to promote net zero: “As the former energy and climate minister who signed net zero by 2050 into law, I’ve been determined to show that net zero isn’t just about going green; it is essential for future economic growth. One of the reasons why I’m out on tour with the all-party environment group which I chair is to demonstrate how net zero is going to benefit the lives of people across every region.”He said the review would look at how to incentivise businesses to take up the green industrial revolution and increase growth. “There is a green industrial revolution happening across the country that Westminster is slow to wake up to. Businesses are just getting on with net zero. But further to government support, we need to go further in creating a supply-and-demand-side revolution in renewable and clean energy and energy efficiency measures.“That means looking again at how we can change and reform financial incentives, regulations, planning, and much more to help make going net zero even easier and unleashing a clean economic growth revolution.”During the leadership election campaign, Skidmore was part of a small group of Conservative MPs, including the Cop26 chair, Alok Sharma, and the environment minister Zac Goldsmith, who encouraged the candidates to sign up to the net zero pledge.Truss signed up at the time, and said she would look at how to put net zero into practice while encouraging economic growth.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

56," This article is more than 1 month old‘I’ve never seen anything like this’: Japan says reason behind 1,200 tonnes of fish washing ashore is unknownThis article is more than 1 month old",The sardines and mackerel were found floating on the surface of the sea near the fishing port of Hakodate in Hokkaido,"Officials in Japan have admitted they are struggling to determine why hundreds of tonnes of fish have washed ashore in recent days.Earlier this month, an estimated 1,200 tonnes of sardines and mackerel were found floating on the surface of the sea off the fishing port of Hakodate in Hokkaido, forming a silver blanket stretching for more than a kilometre.Japan zoo investigates possible mass squirrel poisoningRead moreOn Wednesday, officials in Nakiri, a town on the Pacific coast hundreds of miles south of Hokkaido, were confronted with 30 to 40 tonnes of Japanese scaled sardines, or sappa, which had been observed in the area a couple of days earlier.Local fishers scrambled to collect the fish, fearing their carcasses would lower the oxygen content of the water as they decompose and damage the marine environment.“I’ve never seen anything like this before,” a fisher who has worked in the area for 25 years told the Mainichi Shimbun. “It was only around last year that we began to catch sappa in Nakiri. It makes me wonder if the marine ecosystem is changing.”Experts have speculated that the migratory fish in both areas had become stranded after being chased to the point of exhaustion by amberjack and other predatory fish. Mass mortality events can also occur when there are sudden drops in the water temperature, causing the fish to go into shock, they added.But no one has been able to confirm the cause. “The cause is unknown at the moment,” Mikine Fujiwara, a local fisheries official, told the newspaper. “We plan to sample the seawater at the site and examine it to uncover the cause.”Japanese government officials have blasted a report in the British newspaper the Daily Mail that appeared to link the phenomenon to the release of treated water from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.Local authorities are urging people not to consume the fish. Photograph: 瀬尾遊/APThe report noted that dead fish had begun washing ashore almost four months after the plant began discharging the water – which contains small quantities of the radioactive isotope tritium – into the Pacific.The International Atomic Energy Agency approved the plan, stating in a safety review that discharging the water would have “a negligible radiological impact on people and the environment”.China, which opposed the release and imposed a ban on Japanese seafood, has been accused of hypocrisy since its own nuclear plants routinely pump wastewater with higher levels of tritium than that found in Fukushima’s discharge.“We are concerned about unsubstantiated information,” a Japanese fisheries agency official told the Asahi Shimbun.Images of the fish have been widely shared on social media – many accompanied by Fukushima conspiracy theories.“There have been no abnormalities found in the results of water-monitoring surveys,” the fisheries agency said, referring to the water that has been pumped out of the Fukushima plant so far. “We’re concerned about the proliferation of information that’s not based on scientific evidence.”Fishing cooperatives in Fukushima had warned that the discharge would inflict further damage on the reputation of their seafood.Town officials in Hakodate urged local people not to consume the stranded fish amid reports that some were gathering quantities to sell or eat. “We don’t know for sure under what circumstances these fish were washed up, so I don’t recommend eating them,” Takashi Fujioka, a fisheries researcher said.","**Headline:** Massive Fish Die-Off Baffles Experts

57," Value of cryptocurrency bitcoin climbs 5% to record high of $63,000",Several digital currencies surge a day before launch of Coinbase trading platform on Wall Street,"The value of the cryptocurrency bitcoin has surged to a record high, reaching $63,000 (£45,800).The cryptocurrency, which has risen in value by 450% in the last six months, continued to climb by a further 5% during trading on Tuesday.Bitcoin’s price has more than doubled since the start of 2021. The digital currency has been on a rollercoaster ride in the last year, and was trading at about only $7,000 in April 2020.The smaller, rival cryptocurrency Ethereum also rose on Tuesday, reaching its own record high of $2,205.The fresh records were set a day before the launch of the US’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase, on Wall Street’s tech-heavy Nasdaq stock exchange.Coinbase’s listing has been viewed by cryptocurrency fans as another sign of its growing mainstream acceptance among investors and financial institutions, and as a means of payment.The price of bitcoin soared towards $60,000 in February amid news of high-profile purchases of the digital currency, including by the electric car company Tesla, run by the billionaire Elon Musk. Tesla announced at the time it had bought $1.5bn in bitcoin and said it might soon accept payments in the currency.Musk, who briefly became the world’s richest man before a slump in the Tesla share price, has previously changed his Twitter biography to “#bitcoin”.Cryptocurrency trading is also enjoying a boom in Turkey, as investors seek refuge from the country’s economic turmoil and surging inflation.Turkey’s economic turmoil drives Bitcoin frenzyRead moreHowever, cryptocurrencies remain controversial, and global regulators including the Bank of England are sceptical, on account of their volatility and vulnerability to theft or hacking.Bitcoin and other digital currencies have also come under increasing fire for their environmental impact, given the huge amount of energy required to create them.New bitcoins are created by “mining” coins, a process that requires computers to carry out complex calculations.

58, From badgers to bumblebees: how drought is affecting Britain’s wildlife,"As garden birds struggle to find food, many species are also at risk of overheating and dehydration","While warm summer days may seem like good news for Britain’s wildlife – and indeed they can be for some warmth-loving insects, such as dragonflies – for many species of bird, mammal and insect the current drought conditions are far from ideal.The British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) has warned that some of our best-loved garden birds are already struggling, as they try to raise their second broods of young. Blackbirds, robins and song thrushes need regular summer rainfall, as this creates the damp conditions that bring earthworms and other soil-dwelling invertebrates to the surface of garden lawns.Droughts mean that the worms stay down in the damper earth, meaning that the birds cannot catch enough to feed themselves or their chicks. This can lead to desperate measures: during the very dry spring and summer of 2011, hungry blackbirds even resorted to cannibalism, feeding on their own offspring. The charity RSPB advises putting out mealworms to provide an alternative food source for the birds.Falling birds and dehydrated hedgehogs: heatwave takes its toll on UK wildlife Read moreGround-feeding mammals such as badgers and hedgehogs are also suffering during this unusually dry weather; not just because they cannot get enough food, but also from overheating and dehydration. And while hot and sunny days may be better than wet and rainy ones for adult butterflies, as they fly from plant to plant to lay their eggs, they are bad news for caterpillars, which need plenty of foliage on their host plants if they are to feed and grow. A recent study showed that in the years following prolonged summer droughts, when plants die off early because of the heat, butterfly populations tend to fall.Other insects find it hard to cope in hot weather, too, but for different reasons. Prof Dave Goulson of the University of Sussex points out that because bumblebees have furry coats – an adaptation to flying and feeding in cool conditions – they are unable to forage in very high temperatures.As temperatures hit record levels, young house martins, swallows and swifts risk fatally overheating. In London recently, young swifts that had been forced to leave their nests before they were fully fledged were seen falling out of the sky. House martins are also unable to find enough mud to build or repair their nests.Prolonged dry weather increases the chances of wildfires, which spread very rapidly, especially on heathland and moorland. As early as April this year, 17 hectares (42 acres) of valuable wildlife habitat was destroyed at Canford Heath in Dorset, threatening the breeding success of rare species such as Dartford warblers, sand lizards and smooth snakes. And in July, a fire raged through the coastal scrub and reedbeds at Wild Ken Hill in Norfolk, home to the BBC’s Springwatch.A Dartford warbler. Photograph: D Middleton/South Downs Centre/PAElsewhere in East Anglia, wetlands such as the Ouse Washes are beginning to dry out. If enough rain does not fall soon, the BTO fears that the young of some wader species, including the avocet, may not be able to find food. Other waders that nest on peatlands may also struggle if the peat dries out, as this would mean that the larvae of craneflies – food for the dunlin and golden plover – are unable to survive.For all these species, a single bad summer, with resulting low breeding success, may not be a total disaster. But if summer droughts become the norm, because of the cumulative effects of the climate crisis, then breeding populations can decline very rapidly indeed.This is not the first time a summer drought has caused problems for wildlife. Anyone who lived through the summer of 1976 will recall the “plague of ladybirds” that appeared from July onwards, forcing holidaymakers to flee from beaches covered with thousands of these black-and-red beetles. Ladybirds had initially benefited from the dry weather, which produced an early glut of their favourite food, aphids. But as the drought continued, and plants began to wither and die, the aphid population collapsed, and the ladybirds swarmed in search of alternative food sources.In the decades since, warming temperatures have allowed several exotic species of bird to expand their range northwards. The BTO suggests that the current drought in southern Europe may be hastening that process, allowing black-winged stilts and bee-eaters to breed more frequently in the UK. While that may be good news for birders, this is also a clear sign that climate change is causing problems for these Mediterranean species, and a timely warning to us.","**Headline:** Britain's Wildlife Faces Drought Crisis

59," Before Covid, giving up flying was taking off. We need to get that momentum backAnna Hughes","Interest in low-carbon living, including pledges not to fly, was high before the pandemic. After lockdown, we must not allow climate action to fall off the radar","It’s hard to remember what life was like before the pandemic hit. A year and a half ago, 2019 was drawing to a close with something like a promise. It had been the year of Greta Thunberg, Extinction Rebellion and the school climate strikes, and the momentum was with climate activism. And 2020 promised to be the year of change.Helped by Thunberg’s yacht journey across the Atlantic, the spotlight was on aviation’s role in the climate crisis. An airline ticket is about the most carbon-heavy thing consumers can buy, and for those of us fortunate enough to be able to access air travel, our flights can quickly put us among the top polluters in the world.Climate crisis: Boris Johnson ‘too cosy’ with vested interests to take serious actionRead morePersonalities including John Humphrys drew attention for declaring they’d given up flying, but beyond the headlines a growing number of ordinary people were also quietly ditching plane trips. Enlightened countries, such as Sweden, saw a drop in air bookings, and rail provision rose across Europe. Much Better Adventures led the charge with Tourism Declares a Climate Emergency, a collective of outdoor and travel outfits taking action on the crisis. The travel pages of this paper drastically reduced the number of flights it took and wrote about.It seemed that the zeitgeist was with climate action, giving hope to campaigns such as ours. Flight Free UK was born at the tail end of 2018, with a simple ask: pledge to take a year off flying to reduce emissions and inspire a shift in the narrative around aviation. Having been in the lonely flight-free club myself for more than a decade, I was finally connecting with lots of others making the same choice. We went into 2020 with more than 6,000 signatures on our pledge. Along with climate activists across the world, we dared to hope that our time had come.Someone texted Radio 2 saying: 'Usually we’d be in Zante – but we couldn’t have asked for a better holiday in Whitby'Then Covid came along and stole the headlines. It was certainly a year of change – just not at all what we had imagined. Flight Free 2020 turned out to be a lot more flight-free than we could ever have anticipated.The shackles of lockdown saw two distinct behaviours emerge: pent-up demand for travel led to the emergence of “flights to nowhere”, a ghastly illustration of our addiction to flying; but people also started to appreciate their own neighbourhoods. After months of being cooped up, a swim in the Serpentine could feel as freeing as a dip in the Med. The simple pleasure of walking in UK woods can, with the right attitude, be as eye-opening as trekking in the Atlas mountains. Perhaps being forced to stay put showed us that we don’t have to go far to have a good time.Travel pages have long extolled the virtue of holidaying in your own country but, now compelled to do so, many more people swapped the beaches of Europe for UK ones. My favourite quote from 2020 was someone texting Radio 2 saying: “Usually we’d be in Zante – but we couldn’t have asked for a better holiday in Whitby.”It remains to be seen what effect the Covid crisis will have on our long-term flying habits. According to a YouGov poll, 30% of people plan to fly less after Covid, and only 15% plan to fly more. That may have more to do with coronavirus than climate concern, but now that there is the prospect of some freedom on the horizon, can we recapture that pre-Covid momentum?Some travel companies are on board: in early 2020, Sunvil launched its first rail-only holiday to five Greek destinations , and Inntravel now has a team dedicated to arranging rail journeys instead of flights. Others, such as Intrepid Travel and Wilderness Travel, launched UK trips for the first time last year, and Byway Travel, a 100% flight-free travel agency, started taking bookings.The government has yet to catch up, with multimillion-pound bailouts for airlines, Eurostar left floundering, a potential scrapping of air passenger duty, and yet more hikes in the cost of rail. There is no indication that the UK will follow the example set by France, which has scrapped air routes where a direct rail link of less than 2½ hours exists. The aviation industry is poised to ramp up operations as soon as restrictions are eased.So let’s not let the misery of the pandemic get in the way of our climate ambitions. Now, more than ever, it’s imperative that we take action. We now know that 2020 was the hottest year on record, and the six hottest years ever recorded all occurred in the past decade.The pandemic forced us to stay grounded. In future, could we stay grounded through choice?Anna Hughes is director of Flight Free UK. Find out more and make a flight-free pledge here","**Headline:** Take Action for a Sustainable Future

60," Disease outbreaks more likely in deforestation areas, study finds","Tree-planting can also increase health risks if it focuses too narrowly on small number of species, paper says","Outbreaks of infectious diseases are more likely in areas of deforestation and monoculture plantations, according to a study that suggests epidemics are likely to increase as biodiversity declines.Land use change is a significant factor in the emergence of zoonotic viruses such as Covid-19 and vector-borne ailments such as malaria, says the paper, published on Wednesday in Frontiers in Veterinary Science.Even tree-planting can increase health risks to local human populations if it focuses too narrowly on a small number of species, as is often the case in commercial forests, the research found.The authors said this was because diseases are filtered and blocked by a range of predators and habitats in a healthy, biodiverse forest. When this is replaced by a palm oil plantation, soy fields or blocks of eucalyptus, the specialist species die off, leaving generalists such as rats and mosquitoes to thrive and spread pathogens across human and non-human habitats. The net result is a loss of natural disease regulation.“I was surprised by how clear the pattern was,” said one of the authors, Serge Morand, of the French National Centre for Scientific Research. “We must give more consideration to the role of the forest in human health, animal health and environmental health. The message from this study is ‘don’t forget the forest’.”The researchers examined the correlation between trends for forest cover, plantations, population and disease around the globe using statistics from international institutions such as the World Health Organization, the World Bank, the Food and Agricultural Organization and the Gideon epidemic database. Over the period of study from 1990 to 2016, this covered 3,884 outbreaks of 116 zoonotic diseases that crossed the species barrier and 1,996 outbreaks of 69 vector-borne infectious diseases, mostly carried by mosquitoes, ticks or flies.The paper shows outbreaks increased over time, while plantations expanded rapidly and overall forest cover declined gradually. By itself, a correlation is not proof of causality because other factors may be involved, such as climate disruption. The authors bolster their argument with multiple references to individual case studies that highlight the links between epidemics and land use change.In Brazil, scientists have demonstrated that deforestation increases the risks of outbreaks of malaria. In south-east Asia, studies have shown how forest clearing favours the mosquito Anopheles darlingi, which is a vector for several diseases. Loss of primary forests has also been identified as a factor in the emergence of Ebola in west Africa and the re-emergence of arthropod-borne leishmaniasis.The new study adds to a growing body of evidence that viruses are more likely to transfer to humans or animals if they live in or near human-disturbed ecosystems, such as recently cleared forests or swamps drained for farmland, mining projects or residential projects.This is shaped by trade patterns and consumer behaviour. A quarter of global forest loss is driven by the production of commodities such as beef, soy, palm oil and wood fibre. Mining adds to this problem by contaminating rivers and streams that are vital for a resilient ecosystem, carbon sequestration and soil quality.Morand said his study showed that disease risks needs to be added to risk-benefit analysis of new projects. “We should take the costs of public health into account when considering new plantations or mines. The risks are first to local people, but then worldwide because we have seen with Covid how quickly diseases can spread.”He is particularly concerned about the deteriorating environmental health of the Amazon rainforest. Under the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, deforestation has surged to levels not seen in more than a decade and public health systems have been so mismanaged that the country now has the worst Covid death rate in the world.“Everyone in the field of planetary health is worried about what is happening to biodiversity, climate and public health in Brazil,” Morand said. “The stress there is growing. The Amazon is near a tipping point due to climate change, which is not good at all for the world ecosystem. If we reach the tipping point, the outcomes will be very bad in terms of drought, fires and for sure in terms of disease.”Other areas of concern include the rainforests of the Congo basin and south-east Asia, and monoculture afforestation projects in China, Europe and the US. “Our results clearly suggest that it is not only forest clearance that is responsible for outbreaks of infectious diseases, but also reforestation or afforestation, particularly in countries outside the tropical zone,” the paper notes.Morand is now working on a more detailed study that will use satellite analysis of forest cover to examine links with disease. With more information, he believes it may be possible to predict future outbreaks and to work with local communities to build ecologically diverse and economically productive landscapes that reduce the risks.As the author of a 2016 book called The Next Plague, he says it is only a matter of time until the next pandemic. “The risks are very high. It’s just a case of when and where. We need to prepare.”","**Headline:** Deforestation Linked to Disease Outbreaks

61, This article is more than 5 months oldConsumer watchdog urged to investigate ‘misleading’ Australian oil and gas industry PR campaignThis article is more than 5 months old,"Climate campaigners complain to ACCC over Appea ad that claimed gas was ‘50% cleaner’ than coal

","Environmental campaigners have asked Australia’s consumer watchdog to investigate an oil and gas industry public relations campaign that critics claim is misleading the public on the climate effects of fossil fuel.The Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (Appea) last month dropped a claim in its “Future of Gas” advertising campaign that gas was “50% cleaner” than coal.Ad Standards said the claim was not specific enough and had not been substantiated, finding Appea had breached all three of its codes covering environmental claims.Appea launched the campaign in June to highlight “the importance of natural gas to the nation”.Do the fossil fuel industry’s claims of Australia’s gas-fired future stack up? | Temperature CheckRead moreNow lawyers representing environmental campaigners Lock the Gate and climate advocacy group Comms Declare have asked the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to investigate the campaign.“We hope this is a turning point in preventing greenwashing by coal, oil, and gas companies,” said Belinda Noble of Comms Declare.“Gas is mainly methane, which heats the atmosphere 84 times more than carbon dioxide over 20 years.“Advertising gas as being somehow ‘clean’ or ‘green’ is not only inaccurate – it is also immoral when global warming is causing record temperatures, death and destruction around the globe.”

In the letter to the ACCC, lawyers at the Environmental Defenders Office, representing the complainants, accuse the campaign of potentially misleading the public on several counts.The lawyers write that in some cases the actual climate impact of gas is much worse than the comparison of 50% cleaner than coal.The lawyers also write that comparing the greenhouse gas emissions of gas to coal was “potentially misleading” because it ignored a more relevant comparison to renewable energy.“Failing to disclose this information may lead the reader to the false conclusion that gas is the only energy source that releases less [greenhouse gases] than coal, when in fact renewable energy sources release almost zero [greenhouse gases] in the production of energy,” the complaint says.The letter also says that while the campaign claims gas generates about 20% of the electricity used by Australians, for the majority of people served by the National Electricity Market gas only generated about 6% of power.“Greenwashing is dangerous because it delays action on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and undermines competition and consumer trust in green or renewable products,” said Kirsty Ruddock, managing lawyer at the EDO.“Appea’s statements are designed to make the public think gas is good for the environment, when in fact it is driving dangerous climate change.“It is clearly in the public interest to ensure big polluters and their peak bodies, such as Appea, are held to account for their allegedly misleading or deceptive conduct.”Last month an Ad Standards panel found Appea’s campaign had breached its codes covering environmental claims.The panel investigated a complaint about Appea’s claim in its campaign that gas was “50% cleaner” than coal.The panel ruled the claim was “misleading, as the claim is not specific and does not make clear to the target audience the basis for comparison”.Appea pointed the panel to statements from the International Energy Agency and the former Australian chief scientist Alan Finkel to back up its claim.But a majority of the panel did not consider those sources to be sufficiently detailed to allow the claim to be properly evaluated.Appea has already removed the claim from its campaign. Statements that said gas was “around 50% cleaner than coal for generating electricity” now read “gas produced fewer emissions than coal when used to generate electricity”. Videos containing the claim have also been taken out of circulation.Experts have previously told the Guardian that in Australia’s main electricity grid gas has 61% of the emissions of coal, not 50%. They also point out that coal-fired power is not being replaced by gas in Australia, but by renewables such as solar and wind.The Guardian asked Appea to respond to the concerns raised in the ACCC complaint and to the findings of the AdStandards panel.Samantha McCulloch, Appea’s chief executive, said she believed the advertising was “clear and factual” and the association did not agree with the panel’s finding.“The fact that gas produces around 50% less carbon dioxide emissions than coal when used for power generation is widely established and recognised by leading authorities including the International Energy Agency (IEA), the US Government’s Energy Information Administration (EIA), the US Department of Energy and Australia’s former chief scientist, Dr Alan Finkel, in his review of the National Electricity Market.“However, out of respect for the decision and the process, APPEA promptly updated some campaign material when the decision was brought to our attention to take into account the determination.”","**Headline:** Uncover the Truth About Fossil Fuel Claims

63, ‘Like a scene from Titanic’: floods in Assam submerge entire villages,"India’s monsoon season has been worse than usual, sweeping away possessions and leaving people huddling on raised ground","People living in Assam, in north-east India, are usually stoical about the flooding that occurs to a greater or lesser extent every monsoon season. But this year they say the situation is dramatically worse. “It was like a scene from Titanic,” one man told local media of the rising waters that have flooded all but two of the state’s districts.In some places entire villages are under water, while across the state 114,000 hectares of crops have been submerged and 5,000 livestock have been washed away. For those that remain, fodder is running out.Since April, 82 people have died in the rain and landslides, including two police officers who were swept away on Monday as they attempted a rescue.In the worst-affected areas, life has been reduced to huddling on any tiny patch of raised dry ground that people can find. Families living under tarpaulin tied to bamboo poles are using dwindling supplies of cooking gas to cook basic meals. There is an air of despondency over all that has been lost: furniture, utensils, documents, irreplaceable photos.“There was no time to save anything, it all happened so fast. My house was made of bamboo. It just broke. I saw my possessions vanish in a flash,” said a woman from the village of Nagaon who was sitting with her children and some saucepans on a bed that had been raised above the swirling waters with the help of bamboo poles.The unending rain has raised the water level in the Brahmaputra River and its tributaries, flooding villages. Barpeta district in Lower Assam is the worst hit.The Assam state disaster management authority has said more than 4 million people, including 1 million children, have been affected. It hopes to send trains carrying relief including diesel, petrol and medicine to the affected areas soon.A woman carrying a child wades through flood water in Barpeta. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesPregnant women, mothers with infants, elderly and sick people have been the worst affected. “My mother is 84 and has a heart condition. Her medicines were swept away with everything else. I can’t move while there is water all round and they are predicting more rain,” said Ashok Bohra, a local journalist.Those who are not living in tents on the roadside are in relief camps, where conditions are fast becoming congested and insanitary.Some images of the flooding have been striking. In the state capital, Guwahati, one man was seen strapping together wooden planks for a raft and placing a red plastic table on top with bottles of drinking water, candles, and matchsticks. He sold his wares while rowing through the muddy waters.Elsewhere, a father moved his baby to safety by carrying it in a washing bowl in waist-high water.The Indian army has been taking food parcels to marooned villagers. Soldiers are moving from one place to another in speedboats and inflatable rafts to rescue those stranded.In Guwahati, where the waters are receding, Mazin Mukhtar, an educational theorist, is turning the government schools where he works into relief camps for those who need shelter. “Some of our employees who have homes further away have seen a lot of destruction,” said Mukhtar. “But when these floods recede, families will rebuild their makeshift bamboo homes in the same place, because that’s where their fields and livelihoods are.”Children play at a makeshift camp in Barpeta. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesAssam’s chief minister, Himanta Biswas Sarma, told the Deccan Herald newspaper that the rain was unprecedented. He said he was in regular touch with the federal home minister, Amit Shah, about help with the disaster.Experts say the rain has been double the usual amount, and is an example of the sort of extreme weather event made more likely by the climate crisis.Meanwhile in the Indian capital, Delhi, a prolonged heatwave has made life miserable since mid-March, and in surrounding states the abnormal heat has reduced the wheat yield by between 18% and 30%.Abinash Mohanty, a programme lead at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, said the climate crisis, along with unsustainable landscape planning, was responsible for the flooding.“According to our analysis, there has been a twofold increase in extreme flood events in Assam in the past five decades,” Mohanty said. The only way forward, he added, was for people in Assam to become “flood-ready” and adapt to the changing weather patterns.","**Headline:** Assam Floods: A Devastating Situation

64,Country diary: why do birdwatchers prize the ring ouzel so much?,"Wolf Edge, Staffordshire: This blackbird in disguise is scarce and getting scarcer – but that doesn’t fully explain its addictive appeal","For the tenth time this spring, I’ve come here to catch sight of migrating ring ouzels. I suspect that of all the species that trigger impassioned responses among birdwatchers, this is the bird least known to the British public.The simplest explanation for both these responses is that ring ouzels are wild, upland loners that are getting scarcer almost annually. Today, there are 15,000 spread thinly from northern Scotland to Cornwall. Writing 108 years ago, WH Hudson described finding 40 to 50 breeding pairs near this spot. Now, I doubt I could take you to more than one.Another key explanation for this bird’s enduring appeal is that it triggers simultaneously the full shock of the other, alongside feelings of deepest familiarity. Ring ouzels look like blackbirds, except for a white or milky-tea quarter-moon across the chests in males and females respectively. As Hudson observed, the real joy of the beast is the revelation that “our” favourite garden thrush has a hitherto-unknown feral twin.Naturalists love these pairings and the fine-tuned parings that they demand. It means that every year, spring or autumn – when ring ouzels move through our islands using a series of traditional stopping places – observers must check every single distant, vaguely interesting blackbird until it faces them and confirms its ordinariness. But on every 10,000th occasion, a “blackbird” will turn and all the magic of a ring ouzel unfolds.The key to that rare moment is understanding a sequence of thrushy nuances: the longer wings and a frost-edged character to a ring ouzel’s back and coverts, as well as the rattling neurotic element in its voice. Before everything, however, it is the inexplicably fearful, unapproachable genius of the creature that makes most sightings so fleeting, and the speed of detection so critical.For me, these fine-grained discriminations make a nonsense of the traditional Romantic idea that science diminishes our love and experience of nature; or as Wordsworth proposed, “We murder to dissect”. Ring ouzels are the living outer expressions of an inner revelation that knowledge, including careful rational diagnosis, is no barrier to our encounter with nature, but a fundamentally entwined element in a self-perpetuated, life-loving affair.

65," Plans to mine Ecuador forest violate rights of nature, court rules",Landmark ruling says mining permits issued in Los Cedros protected area breach Ecuador’s constitution,"Ecuador’s highest court has ruled that plans to mine for copper and gold in a protected cloud forest are unconstitutional and violate the rights of nature.In a landmark ruling, the constitutional court of Ecuador decided that mining permits issued in Los Cedros, a protected area in the north-west of the country, would harm the biodiversity of the forest, which is home to spectacled bears, endangered frogs, dozens of rare orchid species and the brown-headed spider monkey, one of the world’s rarest primates.Enami EP, Ecuador’s national mining company, held rights for mining concessions that had been granted in two-thirds of the reserve. The decision means that mining concessions, environmental and water permits in the forest must be cancelled after the court upheld a lawsuit brought by communities near Los Cedros that was successful in a lower court.The ruling by Ecuador’s highest court, published on Wednesday, upheld the rights of nature, which are enshrined in the country’s constitution, and said they applied across the whole country, not just to protected areas.Los Cedros is in the Chocó region of South America that includes parts of Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. It is one of the most biodiverse parts of the planet, home to flora and fauna found nowhere else on Earth.“This is a historic victory in favour of nature,” said Natalia Greene of the Global Alliance for the Rights of Nature, an NGO that argued for the court to keep mining away from Los Cedros.“The constitutional court states that no activity that threatens the rights of nature can be developed within the ecosystem of Los Cedros protected forest, including mining and any other extractive activity. Mining is now banned from this amazing and unique protected forest. This sets a great juridical precedent to continue with other threatened protected forests. Today, the endangered frogs, the spectacled bears, the spider monkey, the birds and nature as a whole have won an unprecedented battle.”Campaigners said the ruling set an important marker across Ecuador and the region, where several other mining and extraction projects are planned in ecologically important areas. Between 2007 and 2008, Ecuador enshrined the rights of nature in its rewritten constitution.Dr Mika Peck, a senior lecturer in biology at the University of Sussex first investigated the biological importance of Los Cedros in the mid-90s, compares the significance of the ruling to Thomas Paine’s Rights of Man, a key text in the American revolution.“It is important for the world to reflect on the limits of nature and to seriously question the effectiveness of current conservation policies and actions,” he said. “Policy frameworks that place humans in context as a part of nature, integrated into a system that balances intrinsic rights between legitimate subjects of the law, rather than placing humans as above, or apart from, nature, will be a necessary part of addressing the serious environmental issues that our planet is facing. This ruling is as important to nature as Thomas Paine’s Rights of Man were to our own species.”The Guardian has contacted Enami EP for comment. This article was amended on 3 December 2021. Dr Mika Peck is not from Ecuador as an earlier version said.","**Headline:** Protecting Nature's Rights**

66,Plantwatch: the strange organism so tough it can survive in space,Lichen survived 18 months attached to outside of International Space Station and raises prospect life could exist on Mars,"Lichens are strange organisms, a partnership between a fungus that offers shelter, water and minerals, and an alga or cyanobacterium that supplies food from their photosynthesis. And even though lichens tend to be modest to look at, they are so incredibly tough that some can even survive the harsh environment of space.When lichens were attached to the outside of the International Space Station for 18 months they survived the vacuum of space, no water, extreme temperatures and the full onslaught of radiation and ultraviolet rays from the sun, and carried on photosynthesising.Lichens that were kept in a simulated Martian environment on Earth survived and were active, raising the prospect that life could exist on Mars, where the environment is intensely dry and cold, with low atmospheric pressure and radiation bombardment. In fact, lichens can cope with radiation 12,000 times the lethal dose for humans and still carry on photosynthesising, although their reproduction can be harmed. However, bacteria given the same treatment died. There is even a thought that life on Earth, or any other planet, could conceivably have been spread through space by lichens hitching a ride on meteorites, comets or asteroids.","**Headline:** The Amazing Organism That Survived in Space

67, This article is more than 2 months oldAlarm raised over water firm job of new environment secretary’s wifeThis article is more than 2 months old,"Steve Barclay married to executive at Anglian Water, which is under investigation for potential illegal dumping of raw sewage

UK politics live – latest updates
","Campaigners have raised concerns over a potential conflict of interest for the new UK environment secretary, Steve Barclay, whose wife is a senior executive at Anglian Water.Barclay took on the environment role in Rishi Sunak’s cabinet reshuffle this week. His wife, Karen Barclay, holds a senior position at the water company, as head of major infrastructure (DCO) planning and stakeholder engagement.As secretary of state, Barclay is responsible for overseeing the regulation of water companies. He is responsible for ensuring the water firms make improvements regarding sewage pollution via the government’s storm overflow reduction plan.Anglian Water is one of six companies under investigation by the regulator Ofwat for potential illegal dumping of raw sewage. The Environment Agency is separately in the middle of a huge criminal investigation into illegal sewage dumping by water companies involving more than 2000 water treatment works.Anglian Water ad banned by regulator over pollution recordRead moreWater companies are pressing government and the regulator Ofwat to approve £96bn investment in infrastructure improvements to fix leaks, stop sewage discharges and build more capacity at treatment plants, which they want customers to pay for via bill rises. Many critics say the public has already paid once for the investment, and should not be made to pay again for fixing problems which put the companies in breach of their legal duties.Tim Farron, the rural spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, said: “Ministers’ spouses do of course have the right to their own careers, but I do worry about the possible conflict of interest here for the man charged with forcing the water companies to clean up their act.“We need to make sure the secretary of state is fully committed to doing everything in his power to stop the sewage scandal.”This summer, Anglian Water pleaded guilty to allowing millions of litres of untreated sewage to overflow from a water recycling centre in Essex. It was fined £2.65m, the largest penalty imposed for environmental offences in the east of England region.Ashley Smith, of Windrush Against Sewage Pollution, said there was a possible conflict of interest for the new secretary of state.“It’s not just that the new environment secretary’s wife holds a senior post at Anglian Water, it is the fact that the water industry routinely operates outside the law, has misappropriated billions of bill payers’ money and now holds the country to ransom to hike bills to fix the mess it made and cannot be trusted to not make off with another windfall gifted by government,” said Smith.A government spokesperson said: “All Defra ministers declare their interests in line with the ministerial code.“There is an established regime in place for the declaration and management of interests held by ministers. This ensures that steps are taken to avoid or mitigate any potential or perceived conflicts of interest.”Craig Bennett, the chief executive of the Wildlife Trusts, who chairs Anglian Water’s independent challenge board, said: “It would prudent for him to make sure this has been declared publicly and that it is all out in the open. Then it is something that can be managed.”Karen Barclay has been approached for a comment. Anglian Water did not comment. The image on this article was replaced on 14 November 2023.

68, ‘The blue flags are proof’: how Greece cleaned up its act on sewage,"Greeks take their seas seriously, with the construction of one of the world’s biggest sewage treatment plants a real game-changer","The shimmering waters along the Athenian riviera offer a welcome respite in the summer heat. In one of Europe’s most congested cities the sight of ever more beaches attaining blue flag status – a mascot of water quality – has heightened the sense of relief that the coastal location affords. For those who flock to its coves, rocks and sandy stretches, the shoreline that extends from the Greek capital’s southern suburbs has become the perfect antidote to the rising temperatures that have accompanied climate breakdown.It was not always so.“More than 20 years ago the waters around Attica [peninsula] weren’t for bathing as they definitely weren’t as clean,” says Prof Konstantinos Aravossis who until earlier this year oversaw water management policies at the Greek ministry of environment. “They are now because a lot of emphasis was put on improving wastewater treatment plants and that, of course, had a lot to do with regulations in the EU.”The establishment in the mid-1990s of a sewage plant on the uninhabited Saronic Gulf isle of Psyttaleia, off the port of Piraeus – an installation serving the 5 million residents of the greater Athens area and one of the largest in the world – is widely acknowledged as being a game-changer.“The blue flags that we see today in Attica are proof of just how much better the situation is,” says Aravossis, who now heads the ministry of environment’s forestry department.But with one of the longest coastline on the continent, Greece also takes its seas seriously. At last count Europe’s southernmost state had 581 blue flag beaches – second only to the 621 in Spain. In 2021, the EU’s environmental watchdog classified nearly 96% of monitored bathing sites in Greece as excellent.A visiting professor at Imperial College London, Aravossis is among Greek officials who have been left astounded by the news of popular beaches in the UK being inundated with raw sewage, and with it all the attendant risks such discharges will inevitably have on the environment and public health.“It’s very unexpected,” he says with noticeable understatement. “Obviously there has not been proper documentation and monitoring of the system. Here in Greece, and especially at the Psyttaleia plant, surveillance is very strict, which does not seem to have been the case in the UK.”Tourism has played a vital role in sensitising Greeks to the importance of keeping their seas and rivers clean. The sector is the national economy’s major industry, employing one in five workers and accounting for an estimated 25% of the country’s gross domestic product.Up and down the land, pristine waters have become a central part of the narrative to lure holidaymakers with the international blue flag programme regarded as a byword for local excellence.Voidokilia beach in Messinia, Greece, which has 581 blue flag beaches. Photograph: Georgios Tsichlis/Alamy“There’s been a very big increase in the number of local town halls and other beach managers applying for blue flag status,” says Dareia-Nefeli Vourdoumpa, at the Hellenic Society for the protection of Nature, the NGO heading the programme in Greece for the past 30 years.“We’re very fortunate to have such natural beauty and we’ve understood how important good ecological management of our beaches and marinas is to tourism.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Excellent water quality over a sustained period and cleanliness of beaches are just some of the factors,” she adds.Fresh off the Archipelagos Institute’s research ship, Thodoris Tsimpidis marvels at the extraordinary biodiversity of the Greek sea – a direct product of waters remaining mercifully unpolluted. “Currents, winds and the fact that our seas are often very deep help enormously,” says the head of the marine conservation body. “Greek waters, it is true, are very clean, even in places where they shouldn’t be, and that is largely because they are aided by natural phenomena.”Archipelagos is among a growing number of organisations established with the express purpose of saving the Aegean and Mediterranean seas from the ravages of modern living. Raw sewage may not be an immediate risk, but plastic is, with alarming predictions by WWF Greece, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and others of plastic waste outnumbering fish in the oceans by 2050.

69,"The Dixie fire is almost out, but its inhospitable ‘moonscapes’ remain","Severe wildfires are making the recovery process for plants and animals more challenging, sometimes for years after the flames","After more than two months, the battle to contain the Dixie fire – a behemoth blaze that swept nearly 1m acres, leveling mountain towns and blackening the conifer-covered landscape – is nearing its end.But even after the fire crews pack up, threats remain for the plants and animals that call this area home. Scientists are warning that the severity of today’s wildfires is making the recovery process increasingly challenging, sometimes for years after the flames are put out.The American west has evolved alongside fire, which is a natural part of the landscape. But fueled by warmer, drier conditions and an overabundance of parched vegetation, blazes are increasingly burning more ferociously, consuming nearly everything in their path.The size but also the severity of today’s wildfires is a growing concern. Fires that exhibit erratic behavior and burn with more intensity are more likely to leave behind only patches of living landscape.“There is the extent of the fire and there is the intensity of the fire. When you get these big intense fires, you mostly kill those animals,” said ecologist Brad Shaffer, the director of the UCLA La Kretz Center for California Conservation Science. “If you don’t kill them then when they come back and it’s just a big ash field, there are no plants and therefore no insects. They starve to death.”In these high-severity burns, vegetation on the forest floor is consumed by the flames, and shrubs and stumps are reduced to ash. The soil itself changes, and even beneath the ground, tree roots are burned. These moonscapes can take between five and 10 years to regenerate – far too long for some species to wait.Scientists are also finding that some landscapes remain permanently changed and trees struggle to grow where they once flourished. Surviving animals, faced with reduced populations after a fire, may resort to inbreeding, ultimately reducing their resilience while the climate becomes less hospitable.Firefighters work to contain the Dixie Fire in California. Photograph: Patrick T Fallon/AFP/Getty Images“What you are creating is analogous to an ocean that has a few little islands on it,” Shaffer said. “It is very hard to move across that super burnt landscape in a short amount of time.” For small animals, like the lizards and amphibians he specializes in, “you have to wait for it to come back”.Shaffer, who is studying how ecosystems recovered in the Woolsey fire, which burned in Los Angeles and Ventura counties in 2018, says research on the issue is still unfolding. But without mitigation, some animals may not be able to adapt.“It’s a very nasty feedback loop,” Shaffer said. “The result is small, isolated, genetically inbred populations that are often extremely compromised, with less resilience to catastrophic challenges associated with climate change and with little chance of recovery.”It’s still unclear what’s been left in the footprint of the Dixiefire. The Burned Area Emergency Response (Baer), specialized crews with the US Forest Service staffed by engineers, biologists, archeologists and other highly trained experts, are deploying into the cooled parts of the Dixie scar to assess the damage.While the official prognosis is yet to come, Brian Rhodes, the deputy director of fire and aviation management with the US Forest Service, says he is optimistic some areas may have been spared the worst. “There are definitely pockets of high severity but not as broad as one would expect,” he said. “Generally speaking I would anticipate it being a mixture of high severity, moderate severity and maybe in some places low severity.”Still, researchers have found that fire severity overall is trending in a more dangerous direction.There’s a concern these forests are going to move away from a forested ecosystem to something elseCamille Stevens-Rumann, fire ecologist“We are seeing an increase in the proportion of area burned at high severity with climate change,” said Camille Stevens-Rumann, an assistant professor at Colorado State University who studies fire ecology and recovery. The hot, windy days when high-severity burning is likely have defined the 2021 fire season, and helped fires like the Dixie evade containment efforts for weeks on end.Those conditions also make it more difficult for forests to heal the ways they once did. Healthy fires tend to burn low to the ground, creeping through the bases of trees and clearing the undergrowth. Severe fires shoot flames hundreds of feet high, scorching the canopies and overcoming natural defenses evolved across centuries. When older trees succumb, seedlings struggle.“Rather than having some standing trees helping shade the ground and keep it cooler and more moist, it’s just this large expanse of black charred earth which can make it difficult for trees to establish,” Stevens-Rumann said. “There’s a lot of concern about whether these forests are going to have a longer-term conversion, moving away from a forested ecosystem to something else,” she added, explaining that, on this trajectory, once-forested landscapes could soon shift to become shrub-covered chaparral, which is more flammable. Chaparral landscapes, in turn, could convert to grasslands.One of the millions of casualties of the Dixie fire. Photograph: Ty O’Neil/SOPA Images/REX/ShutterstockThis could also mean big changes for the animals that live there. “If we had the spotted owl or another endangered species that is used to a dense dark forest, they are not going to use the shrubland ecosystem in the same way, or perhaps at all,” she said. “We are changing the habitat for a lot of different species.”Climate change is the main culprit in increasing the intensity of fires but it has not acted alone. A long history of suppressing natural fire – the kind needed to keep forests healthy – has only made the problem worse.Officials are embracing and implementing badly needed mitigation tools, including forest thinning and prescribed burning, but scientists have said that more urgency and action is needed to slow the changes already under way.“The more preemptive action we can really do to stop that next large, high-severity fire is the best way we are going to maintain forests across our landscape,” Stevens-Rumann said. “A lot of times that’s fighting fire with fire.”","**Headline:** The Aftermath of the Devastating Dixie Fire

70,AnalysisAustralia is on track … sort of: official expert advice urges a ‘big upward shift’ on emissions cutsAdam Morton Climate and environment editor,"Climate change minister tells parliament official projection of 40% cut does not factor in all Labor’s policy commitments

","Australia’s climate change minister, Chris Bowen, has declared the country on track to reach a 40% cut in climate pollution by 2030 – just short of the national target of 43% – but the government has been told a “big upward shift in momentum” is needed to tackle the problem.Giving the country’s first climate statement to parliament, which is now required annually under legislation passed earlier this year, Bowen said the official projection of a 40% cut did not factor in all Labor’s policy commitments, and that those measures would “lift our result to at least 43%”.The statement did not shed light on what the government would do to make deeper cuts in line with its goal of limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, an expectation raised by a UN-backed report if the Great Barrier Reef is to avoid being nominated as a world heritage site “in danger”. It also did not mention the country’s vast coal and gas export industries.Tracking Australia’s progress on the climate crisis and the consequences of global heatingRead moreBut the Albanese government did release three reports on Australia’s performance in dealing with the climate crisis, and what is expected over the next decade. They suggest the government can meet its climate targets if it implements its policies as promised, but also that there is not much time and action needs to accelerate.One of the reports – setting out future emissions projections – assumes proposed gas developments will go ahead at Narrabri in New South Wales, in the Northern Territory’s Beetaloo Basin and at sites in Queensland and off the north coast of Western Australia. The Greens said these developments would “put a safer climate further out of reach”.Here are some other key points.Australia is on track, sort ofWhile Bowen can reasonably claim the latest emissions projections suggest the government’s policies put it within striking distance of hitting its 2030 target, it’s not the main number emphasised. The baseline scenario – based on existing federal, state and territory policies and measures – gets Australia to a 32% cut by 2030 (compared with 2005 levels).The 40% conclusion comes from a “with additional measures scenario” that adds in Labor’s two main climate policies measures, which are still in development. They are changes to the safeguard mechanism – the Coalition scheme that was supposed to put a limit on industrial emissions, but hasn’t – and the “rewiring the nation” policy that is promised to hurry up the electricity transmission connections needed to reach 82% renewable energy on the east coast by 2030.

Other promised policies – a national electric vehicle strategy and a national reconstruction fund that will include investment in climate-friendly projects – are at an earlier stage and were not included in either scenario. A more meaningful analysis that incorporates all policies should be possible next year.But a couple of points can be made now. Nearly all the cuts by 2030 are still coming from the massive change in the electricity system as cheap solar, wind and backup replaces ageing coal plants. Just on announcements to date, including a new connection between NSW and Victoria and the Marinus link across Bass Strait, renewable energy is projected to provide 76% of generation.Elsewhere, there is little action yet. Emissions from transport, leaky mines and agriculture are expected to keep increasing. And the cut in pollution assumed from big industrial sites covered by the safeguard mechanism is modest.Tracking Australia’s progress on the climate crisis and the consequences of global heatingRead moreThe government has said it expects industrial sites covered by the safeguard mechanism to cut emissions by between 3.5% and 6% a year. The chief executive of the Carbon Market Institute, John Connor, points out that the projections assume the cut will be at the bottom end of this range. He is among those who say the changes to the safeguard, which sets emissions limits for 215 big polluting facilities, need to go much further.Looking ahead, the report projects the country is on track for just a 48% cut by 2035, suggesting a slow down after 2030 and far below what will be necessary. It is a rough estimate, but tells us again that significant new policies will be needed before the next election if the Albanese government is going to live up to its rhetoric on aiming for 1.5C.What the official advice saysThe first annual progress report by the Climate Change Authority makes clear what we know: the impact of the crisis is intensifying, with communities experiencing “more frequent, intense and prolonged extreme weather events”. It says deeper cuts are needed to avoid even worse events, and more needs to be done on adaptation and resilience.The authority stresses the country needs a big shift in momentum on emissions cuts to meet the government’s “ambitious new targets”. On average, the country needs to cut emissions by 17m tonnes a year – more than 40% faster than what has happened since 2009.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The message is that everyone has to act, though not necessarily at the same pace, and that the climate crisis needs to be “at the forefront of all government decision-making”.Another key point: while the technologies to meet the 2030 target exist, supply chain disruption, labour skills shortages and slow planning processes are potential roadblocks and all need to be improved.Bowen said the government accepted all of the authority’s recommendations.What Bowen saidSpeaking before a large number of invited foreign diplomats, including many from the Pacific, Bowen stressed the government’s early successes, including passing the climate legislation that set the emissions reduction targets in law. He said the projection of a 40% cut by 2030 was a one third improvement from a year ago, when it was 30% under the Coalition.He emphasised that the climate crisis has moved from a theory, to a prediction, to a lived reality that spares no one and described not acting as “an unforgivable act of intergenerational negligence”. He quoted the International Energy Agency, saying: “The world is struggling with too little clean energy, not too much. Faster clean energy transitions would have helped to moderate the impact of this crisis, and they represent the best way out of it.”Australia still trails most developed countries in climate performance ranking Read morePointing ahead to an expected battle over the safeguard mechanism, the minister noted that about 70% of facilities covered by the scheme had net zero commitments – an implicit warning that resistance to change would be at odds with their own promises.“Business as usual can’t be the usual business any more,” he said. “Businesses must step up and deliver on their commitments during this critical decade for climate action.”Meanwhile, pollution continuesFinally, the government released the latest quarterly emissions data, showing Australia’s climate pollution was basically flat – up 0.1% – over the year to June. Total emissions were for the year were 486.9m tonnes.Electricity emissions were down 3.7%. Transport emissions fell 1%, but only because of Covid-19 lockdowns in late 2021. Pollution from manufacturing, agriculture and the liquified natural gas industry were all up – and it is expected to increase from pollution in the next report.National emissions were 21.6% below 2005 levels – nearly exactly halfway to the 2030 goal. But the scale of the task at hand is better illustrated when emissions from land and forestry are removed.The rest of the economy, including all industries that rely on fossil fuels, are down only 2.8% over the past 17 years.00:02:58The truth about getting to net zero, according to the numbers – video","**Headline**: Australia's Climate Change Progress

","The Darling-Baaka River at Menindee is on the brink of another environmental catastrophe, with dead fish already appearing along 30km of the river compromised by the last fish kill in March, according to experts.The office of the chief scientist is due to report by 31 August on the causes of the March disaster, which killed millions of bony herring (also known as bony bream) and thousands of other native fish and carp.But a survey by the NSW Department of Fisheries conducted in June, which has not been released, has revealed the poor state of the river between Menindee and Pooncarie.Dead Murray cod are already appearing in the river months before summer. Photograph: Graeme McCrabbThe Guardian understands the fisheries survey found the river already had very low levels of oxygen due to the breakdown of fish carcasses, which is expected to worsen when temperatures increase.The survey found only two mature Murray cod in a 140km stretch of river between Menindee and Pooncarie, suggesting the population has been decimated.Menindee resident Graeme McCrabb said dead fish, including cod, were being found every day around the weir pool at Menindee township, raising concerns about the quality of the town’s drinking water, and about what might occur in coming months.Wayne Smith, who owns a property 60km downstream from Menindee, said there were already high levels of algae in the river due to the nutrient load from the fish.

“The water quality just looks bad; it’s like grey dishwater,” he said.Several major fish kills have occurred in the stretch of river near the township.In January 2019 hundreds of thousands of fish died because of lack of flow and high temperatures leading to stratification of water and a lack of oxygen in the few pools providing refuge to fish.In January the region experienced record flooding. In March, millions of bony herring, which boomed during the floods, died in a fish kill that dwarfed the events of 2019.Menindee local Ross Files, who was born in the town in 1939, said fish kills were not regular events.“We never had a fish kill in the river until they started growing cotton in the catchment up north. It never happened,” he said.Regulated part of Darling-Baaka River and site of mass fish killThe March fish kill is still being investigated by the chief scientist, but a possible cause could be that the millions of new bony herring that spawned during the floods became trapped at the upper weir and consumed all the oxygen in the water.The office of the NSW chief scientist has also been asked to investigate longer-term issues around management of the river system and future emergency responses.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to The Rural NetworkFree newsletterSubscribe to Calla Wahlquist's fortnightly update on Australian rural and regional affairsEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When water temperatures start to warm up again as we move toward spring and summer, there remains a risk of further fish deaths in the Darling River at Menindee, as fish in an already stressed condition may succumb to any decrease in dissolved oxygen and increased competition for depleting resources.“This is particularly the case for bony herring, which boomed during the recent floods, and many are now in poor condition and more susceptible to environmental stresses.”She said the government was continuing to release water from Lake Pamamaroo to support fish populations.Dr Darren Saunders, the deputy chief scientist, said his report was on track to be finished in about three weeks.“We have spent time listening to the community and we are very conscious of their concerns,” he said.“We are now in the middle of doing our own sampling of the river and lakes and we are looking at developing improved emergency response measures to be put in place as soon as possible.“But we are going to have a data driven response wherever possible.”","**Headline:** Darling-Baaka River Faces More Fish Kills

72,New calls to restrict Wimbledon’s plastic bottles – despite Nadal’s ritual,"The Spaniard likes to line up single-use bottles, but Laura Robson says tournament must up its environmental game","The former junior Wimbledon champion Laura Robson has joined calls for Wimbledon to limit the use of plastic bottles.The 28-year-old added that Wimbledon should ban single-use bottles altogether or limit players to just one, adding that fines for breaching the rules were “maybe something that needs to happen”.But the Olympic silver medallist acknowledged that restrictions would hit Spain’s Rafael Nadal, because he is “superstitious” and known for carefully lining up multiple water bottles as part of a long-established courtside ritual.In a panel discussion about the environment at SW19 today, Robson said: “There are all the players on the practice courts, just taking a couple of sips from a water bottle and then leaving it there. Should there be a fine, maybe? We’re joking about it, but maybe that’s something that needs to happen.“I don’t know how you would go about implementing that, whether you would have court covers snitching on people on the court. I don’t know how you would go about organising it but it would be a start.”Robson was joined by Hattie Park, the All England Lawn Tennis Club’s sustainability manager, and former GB rower Melissa Wilson, who said Wimbledon should follow the French Open’s lead. Players used only reusable bottles this year after a government ban in France on single-use plastic.“The players had to use reusable bottles and they were branded by a sponsor,” Park said. “I think the fact that that’s just happened at another grand slam tournament … offers potentially an alternative [for Wimbledon].”Former junior Wimbledon champion Laura Robson retires at 28Read moreBut Robson said athletes would need to stick to one bottle for the plan to be effective. “I was watching a lot of matches in Paris and people had multiple reusable bottles because you’ve got your water, your energy drinks, your electrolytes and all sorts,” she said. “As soon as you put someone then using five reusable bottles, it sort of loses its power.”Campaigners have criticised Wimbledon and Evian, which sponsors the competition, for providing players with single-use bottles. Hundreds of thousands of bottles are used at the tournament each year, with an estimated 420,000 distributed in 2019.Maja Darlington, a plastics campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: “Wimbledon is a world renowned event. If they can afford to pay players £50,000 for simply participating in the first round, they can afford to provide them with reusable water bottles and ensure they aren’t contributing to the ever-growing plastic crisis.”Robson said that tennis has “such a long way to go” to become environmentally friendly but introducing reusable cups on court could be a “big change”.“We’ve also got players who are superstitious – you know, Rafael with his water bottles, and they all need to be in a certain row,” she said. “There’s other players who prefer the plastic bags around the rackets after a restring. And it’s just slowly but surely changing the mindset.”Nadal, a 22-time grand slam title winner, has commented on his courtside routine, saying he takes “a sip from one bottle, and then from another. And then I put the two bottles down at my feet, in front of my chair to my left, one neatly behind the other, diagonally aimed at the court.”He has previously been hit with a number of violations for taking too long between points as he performs his ritual, which also includes picking at his underwear.Sign up to Down to Earth, our exclusive weekly newsletter from our top climate crisis correspondents.Robson said there were wider problems with tennis’s environmental credentials: “We’re travelling every week. Usually on a plane – there’s hardly any opportunities to use other forms of transport – and then you get to a big tournament like this. And you know, there’s a fleet of Land Rovers, which are lovely, but not necessarily that environmentally friendly.”Park said the club was working with Evian about the possibility of installing water refill stations on court, and spectators could bring reusable bottles to SW19. The club has previously said Evian’s bottles are made from 100% recycled plastic.On environmental goals, Park added: “There’s progress that we need to go way up, we are actively talking with our partners about how we can improve and get better.”","# Wimbledon's Plastic Problem

73, Fire-ravaged Greek island of Evia hit by floods and mudslides,"Experts say loss of forests, which act as natural flood control mechanism, has worsened impact of heavy rain ","Storms and heavy rain have laid bare the scale of the destruction wreaked by massive fires on the Greek island of Evia, with communities now having to deal with flooding and mudslides.After a summer of record temperatures igniting unprecedented wildfires across Greece, authorities in affected regions have now been put on the defensive as the nation is hit by a second bout of severe weather in less than a week.“We’ve already seen unusual amounts of rain in some parts of the country,” said Dr Kostas Lagouvardos, a research director at the National Observatory of Athens. “But from Thursday we expect this [new] weather system will create a very dangerous situation, especially in burned areas where the soil is already saturated and streams are overflowing.”An estimated 300,000 acres of forest and bushland were incinerated in Greece over the summer amid temperatures that hit 47.1C, the highest on record.More than a third of the devastated area was in northern Evia, according to the national observatory. In recent weeks communities have been in a race to construct flood barriers to compensate for lost forest cover, with authorities clearing riverbeds and people piling sandbags around their homes.Flames burn on the mountain near Limni village on the island of Evia, on 3 August. Photograph: Michael Pappas/APHowever, for many the storms have already been calamitous: more than 200 houses were damaged at the weekend as heavy rain and widespread flooding made roads impassable, sending mudslides cascading down mountains now devoid of vegetation into the sea.“The situation is dramatic. A mountain of mud has been removed from the village,” said Giorgos Tsapourniotis, the mayor of Mantoudi, likening the scenes to a biblical catastrophe. “We have hundreds of calls to pump out water from homes.”Evia locatorBy Thursday as the storms reached Athens, ripping masonry from the Greek parliament and in some cases forcing children to be evacuated from schools, the weather service had issued a red alert warning people to avoid any unnecessary movement. Heavily forested areas north of the capital were also decimated by wildfires in August.“What we are witnessing is the loss of critical ecosystem services that forests provide,” said Demetres Karavellas, who heads WWF Greece, noting that the Evia wildfire was the biggest ever recorded in Greece. “The natural ability of the soil to withhold water, to act as a flood control mechanism, has been destroyed across a massive area.”The Mediterranean has been singled out as a wildfire hotspot, with forest fires erupting from France to Turkey over the summer. Scientists agree that the climate crisis is partly to blame for creating the conditions that make forests more vulnerable and floods easier. With temperatures hotter than they had been for 30 years, bone-dry terrain had been transformed into a tinderbox fuelling hundreds of fires “in every corner of the country”, the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, said at the time.Firefighters pump water following a flood at the village of Agia Anna, at the northern part of Evia. Photograph: Thodoris Nikolaou/APWithout assistance from more than 20 countries deploying firefighters and water-dropping planes, emergency services would not have been able to cope.Karavellas said there was “a sense of deja vu” with fires of ever-growing ferocity being recorded because of poor forest management policies and lack of follow-up after the blazes.“The key issue here is prevention. We have to stop such fires happening in the first place by moving from a paradigm of suppression to prevention with whatever that entails,” he said. “If we were ill-prepared in the past, there is no excuse now.”","**Headline:** Greece's Fire-Ravaged Island Battles Floods and Mudslides

74,‘We have given Earth a fever’: author John Vaillant on the firestorms coming for us all,His book about a blaze so hot it vaporised concrete and turned a Canadian city to ash has just won the Baillie Gifford prize. John Vaillant explains why the world we think we live in no longer exists,"On the afternoon of 3 May 2016, firefighters spotted a plume of smoke near the Canadian oil city of Fort McMurray. It was early in the fire season for the subarctic region and slabs of ice were still floating on its lakes. A water-bombing helicopter was immediately scrambled but it was already too late. Within two hours, flames had roared through 60 hectares (150 acres) of forest. By the end of the day, 90,000 people had been driven from their homes. Whole neighbourhoods had been reduced to ash.A week later, recalls John Vaillant in Fire Weather, a gripping account that has just won the Baillie Gifford prize for nonfiction, the city looked as if it had suffered a nuclear blast. All that remained of many houses was piles of nails. Sifting through the ashes of her home in what had been a five-storey building, a local journalist found just a colander and some barbecue tools. Even the ceramic toilet had been vaporised.Vaillant was working on his second novel at a writing retreat in Italy when the story began to circulate on social media. “It was like hearing Houston was on fire,” he says. “Fort McMurray is the petroleum hub of Canada. It’s a wealthy, powerful, charismatic, overbuilt place and the idea of it being on fire was absolutely shocking.” The city, Vaillant goes on, “was shrouded in a firestorm cloud 45,000ft tall. The fire had punctured the stratosphere, generating its own lightning and hurricane-force winds.”Firestorm … an abandoned truck on Alberta Highway 63 near Fort McMurray. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesAmazingly, the evacuation was so efficient that the only two fatalities were due to a car crash in the rush to get out. In their efforts to describe the horror, the survivors reached for fantasy: to Tolkien’s fire demon Balrog; and to the asteroid-strike fires of the film Armageddon. These survivors, says Vaillant, bear witness to the future. “Spending time with them was like spending time with Isaiah or Ezekiel – except they’re named Carol and Dave and Rob, and they do regular jobs. But they saw something most of us have never seen and never want to see.”Our concept of England is like our concept of Canada: not flammable. But we’re being forced to recalibrate very rapidlyTalking to Vaillant is itself rather like being sucked into a vision of hell. A silver-haired 61-year-old who moved from Massachusetts to settle in Vancouver 25 years ago, he only started writing in his 30s, specialising in the collision between human beings and the natural world. The Golden Spruce, published in 2006, told the story of an anti-logger who took a drastic measure: felling a tree sacred to the Haida people to raise awareness about the dangers of cutting down many more trees elsewhere. Four years later, The Tiger followed a hunt for a man-eater in the frozen wastes of the Russian taiga. Whereas these earlier books were about finding an accommodation with nature, Fire Weather is about what happens when none can be found.Bright-eyed and urgent the morning after his win, Vaillant talks with messianic fervour about the bigger theme of Fire Weather: a global breakdown in climate conditions capable of supporting life. It’s not lost on him that we’re sitting in chilly London, where runaway bush fires feel like distant TV spectacles. But don’t be fooled, he warns. “Our concept of England is like our concept of Canada: not flammable. But we’re being forced to recalibrate very rapidly, and it creates enormous dissonance psychically and intellectually. And that’s where climate change has an advantage over us, because we’re really attached to the old world we grew up in. We built all our responses, planning and infrastructure around a world that really doesn’t exist any more.”Atmospheric heat and dryness of the forest floor were the key ingredients in the lethal cocktail that destroyed Fort McMurray, creating a fire that burned with a new ferocity, reaching record temperatures. But there was another factor: a suburban sprawl of homes built and furnished with the same petrochemicals on which the Alberta city had made its fortune.Raging … people flee the flames. Photograph: Jeromegarot/Twitter/EPA“Spalling,” writes Vaillant, “is a verb you don’t encounter much below 500 degrees.” It’s what happens to concrete when all the water is burned out of it. Part of the job of the writer, he believes, is to find a vocabulary for this new reality. “Words possess spell-casting, shock-inducing power even in this jaded age.” The English language, he says, already has terms for all this, but there hasn’t been much need for them. Now, like firefighters, they are being called up and sent in to action. He cites another word: “Infandous – a thing too horrible to be named or uttered. For a mayor or fire chief, fire running rampant through a town they are charged with protecting is infandous.”The problem with dealing with infandous situations is if they are too horrible to be named, they usually don’t get planned for. This is what happened in Fort McMurray and its surrounding forests: firefighters ended up having to bulldoze gaps through the city’s housing to stop the blaze. This sort of failure of imagination has been dubbed the Lucretius problem by Black Swan author Nassim Nicholas Taleb, who paraphrased the Roman poet and philosopher with the words: “The fool believes the tallest mountain in the world will be equal to the tallest he has observed.”This problem is compounded by the refusal of nations and businesses to disinvest in oil, despite decades of warnings. Back in 1979, big oil seemed united behind the stated mission of the first World Climate Conference – to “foresee and prevent potential manmade changes in climate that might be adverse to the wellbeing of humanity”. But recently, says Vaillant, something has changed in the petroleum industry. “I don’t know if it’s since the invasion of Russia, or if maybe the petroleum industry sees the end coming, but they seem more openly profit-driven, and less interested in wasting time mincing words about greenwashing. They’re insisting, ‘No we’re going to burn as long as we can.’”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to BookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books with our expert reviews, author interviews and top 10s.

Photograph: John Sinal/Baillie Gifford Prize for Non-Fiction/PAAnd the Carols and Daves and Robs of Fort McMurray go along with this, because many of them come from impoverished coastal areas of Canada and need to earn a living. In this, they are not dissimilar from the young Mexican migrant who featured in Vaillant’s 2015 debut novel, The Jaguar’s Children. “These are folks from remote rural areas with really limited opportunities, who are trying to participate in the 21st century. And the petroleum industry pays well, but you’re being paid well to destroy the Earth.”Two years after the Fort McMurray blaze, Vaillant reported for the Guardian on another big wildfire in Redding, California. These already feel like ancient history, he says. “Over the last summer alone, Canada has generated 100 cumulonimbus fire clouds. These are major planetary phenomena, not unlike hurricanes, except they’re born out of fire. Volcanoes are usually the only natural thing that can generate that much energy.”Who needs fiction when nature can provide such a fast-moving, harrowing story? “The 21st century is a place we’ve never been,” he says, “And that’s not a facetious statement. People talk about the new normal but there is no such thing. And there never will be. What we are in now is clima incognita – the unknown climate. This is what our lives are going to be. And fire is just one particularly charismatic manifestation of that. Obviously, you’re having floods and droughts and other phenomena that are all driven by the same engine. It really all comes down to heat and the energy it generates, and all that comes back to carbon dioxide and methane.”How has Vaillant’s research affected his own lifestyle? “Well, I’m flying all over the place right now,” he says. “I’m practically living in a jet. But I’ve really never felt like this about a book before. I will serve it as long as people want to talk about it, because I can’t think of anything more important. We’ve given this earth a fever. And the irony is that the fossil fuel industry is, in essence, a fire industry: we draw these substances from the ground at great expense so we can burn them.”A chill passes through the room as Vaillant’s tone turns truly apocalyptic. “Fire has empowered us and enriched us beyond our wildest dreams. But the strange side-effect is that we’ve also empowered the climate. We now live in a world that is more explosively flammable than at any time in human history.” John Vaillant’s Fire Weather: A True Story from a Hotter World is published by Sceptre.

75,Country diary: Quick thinking to save a slow worm,"West Dartmoor, Devon: The shape of these legless lizards is smooth and uniform, as if rolled by a child from Play-Doh","I came across it stretched out on the lane in the sunshine like a length of cable. A handspan from end to end, it took a moment to recognise the gleaming cord as a living creature – a slow worm, soaking up the warmth of the road surface. It’s a species I seldom see alive around my Dartmoor home.Over the years I have regularly found dead individuals along this village lane: golden bracelets hammered flat by passing traffic. This one, lying motionless, was risking the same fate, so I crouched down to pick it up.Roused from its stupor, it began wriggling frantically, fully charged with solar energy. I had to be careful not to grasp its rear end as a slow worm will shed its tail to escape, being a legless lizard – a term that sounds like the punchline to a joke about boozing reptiles.Country diary: A warm and safe place for slow worms to breedRead moreWhile a slow worm can be mistaken for a snake, it lacks the contours of a serpent, the jawline or patterning. Its simple shape is a smooth cylinder that hardly distinguishes head from body from tail – it might have been rolled by a child from Play-Doh.Once in my hands, it calmed and I could observe it more closely. The burnished colouring reminded me of brass trumpet pipe, while dark flanks and belly, coupled with a pencil line of black down the back, indicated that this was a female. Males are greyer, more uniform in colour and have a light underside.I took it through to my garden and released it beneath a piece of corrugated iron laid on top of my compost heap. The rusting metal sheet was put there several years ago in the hope that slow worms would be attracted by the trapped heat beneath. So far, it had only provided shelter for a toad or two.Slow worms are widespread reptiles in the UK, known to make themselves at home in gardens, both rural and urban, and I hope this one sticks around. They are supposedly long-lived – at least those that avoid basking on tarmac. So until they evolve decent road sense, I’m happy to act as crossing patrol and steer those I find to safety.

76,‘Everyone will be watching’: US midterms cast a long shadow over Cop27,Some fear the outcome of the 8 November elections might derail US leadership on the global climate crisis,"For Joe Biden, the United Nations climate summit in Egypt is the crowning stage to trumpet the US finally passing major legislation to slow dangerous global heating. But the thoughts of the US president and delegates from around the world are likely to nervously flit to events 6,000 miles (9,65km) away – knife-edge midterm elections back in America.The climate talks, known as Cop27, begin in earnest on Monday when more than 90 heads of state convene in Sharm el-Sheikh amid warnings from scientists that the world is heading towards disastrous climate breakdown without further, deeper cuts in planet-heating emissions. António Guterres, secretary general of the UN, has warned governments heading to Egypt that they face “economy-destroying levels of global heating” and that their efforts to stem this disaster were falling “pitifully short”.‘Climate carnage’: UN demands funding surge to save millions of livesRead moreBiden’s administration is aiming to enter Cop27 in a mood of determined optimism, officials have said in briefings, having successfully secured passage of the landmark Inflation Reduction Act thanks to Democratic votes in Congress over the summer, a $370bn (£331bn) package to boost clean energy that is the first significant climate bill ever enacted by the US.But the White House’s attempts to portray the US as an empowered standard-bearer of climate action risk being undermined just a day into the conference, with midterm elections on Tuesday potentially shifting control of Congress to Republicans, sharply critical of what they call the president’s “radical green agenda”.Biden will arrive in Sharm el-Sheikh on 11 November, shortly after the midterm election, but probably before the full results of the vote. The prospect of the president’s program being partially unpicked by Republican gains would dampen hopes of further progress from the world’s largest historical emitter of greenhouse gases.The US will arrive with a good message that it’s a leader on climate, but the political winds can quickly changeAlice Hill“Everyone at Cop27 will be watching the US election and will be trying to understand what it means, it will affect the overall tenor of the talks,” said Nathan Hultman, a climate policy expert who was part of the US’s negotiating team at last year’s Cop26 talks in Scotland.“We have this strong, transformational body of work from Congress which has completely changed the narrative on the US. We are in a good position to reach our emissions reduction target, but obviously it is harder if elections don’t go to plan.”Two-thirds of US money for fossil fuel pours into Africa despite climate goalsRead moreThe US has been a hugely influential yet unreliable actor during the climate crisis, with its unusually partisan politics leaving leaders of other countries to nervously watch American elections for sharp swings in climate policy. “The US will arrive with a good message to tell that it is a leader on climate, but the political winds can quickly change,” said Alice Hill, a former advisor to Barack Obama, now climate expert at the Council on Foreign Relations.“If the results go against the Democrats we are unlikely to see more climate legislation and there will be more legal challenges to actions taken by the Biden administration. There will be question marks over how much the US can follow through on climate.”John Kerry, Biden’s climate envoy, has remained bullish over the prospects of using American influence in Egypt. Scientists have warned that the world remains badly off track to avoid disastrous climate change, with emissions reduction pledges to date delivering a likely 2.5C (4.5F) in global heating, over pre-industrial times, which is well beyond the internationally-agreed ‘safe’ limit of 1.5C (2.7F).“No country has a right to be delinquent in not putting up an NDC [a nationally determined contribution to cut emissions], not strengthening it where they can, and not being part of this effort,” Kerry said in a recent briefing with journalists, adding that “everybody needs to do their part here” and he wants “to make sure that everybody understands we’re doing the things necessary to keep 1.5C alive”.A sign promoting Cop27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Photograph: Thomas Hartwell/APKerry is likely to come under pressure at Cop27 from developing countries unhappy that a promised $100bn (£89.4bn) a year from rich countries in climate finance has yet to be delivered, as well as on the issue of loss and damage, which would provide poorer nations a form of compensation from floods, heatwaves, droughts and other impacts they did little to cause themselves.A group of 143 climate groups have written to Kerry to criticize the US’s “recalcitrant” stance on loss and damage, demanding progress on the issue in Egypt. “The United States has stood in the way over the loss and damage facility, and countries that are suffering right now are still demanding that facility,” Vanessa Nakate, a Ugandan climate justice activist, said recently. “I need to see the United States helping those that are suffering right now.”Delegates from less wealthy countries say they are almost at their wits’ end over the lack of progress on damages paid by the US and others. “We recognize the key role of the US in these climate talks and we congratulate their steps to taking leadership in the fight against climate change domestically,” said Madeleine Diouf Sarr, a Senegalese official who is chair of the Least Developed Countries, a negotiating bloc of 46 nations.World leaders at Cop27 can’t ignore the plight of imprisoned Alaa Abd El-Fattah | Caroline LucasRead moreBut Sarr added that “we are reaching the point where our patience with hearing the same old arguments is over. Now, look around the world to see all the devastation that could not be adapted to, It is simply obvious that climate change outpaces our abilities to perfectly prepare for it. We cannot rebuild houses with words.”US negotiators have said they are open to discussing the idea at Cop27, but are wary of opening up any sort of liability that could be imposed upon America. Kerry said he wanted “serious dialogue” over loss and damage but has not committed to any form of deal. Regardless, Republicans would probably try to scupper any attempt at providing any sort of new climate aid to developing countries, should the GOP prevail in the midterms.“Biden still has two years left in his term and there are now strong regulations in place that will be sticky and help nudge the existing momentum on renewable energy and electric cars,” said Hultman. “Depending on that momentum, the outcome of the election may not be hugely consequential. But we will have to see how things lie after 8 November.”Democrats, meanwhile, are not only fretting over their electoral prospects going into Cop27 but are questioning the setting of the talks themselves, given Egypt’s dismal human rights record. “Egypt was the wrong choice for Cop27,” said Don Beyer, a Democratic congressman who has called on Kerry to raise human rights issues with the Egyptian government. “Its government jails environmental and political activists and treats NGOs as a threat.”","**Headline:** The World Watches as US Midterms Loom over Climate Talks

77,Country diary: For a moment it’s just me and a golden plover,"Northam Burrows, Devon: This glowing bird is not quite sure what to do with itself, and nor am I","Flooded pools and saturated ground have deterred most of the walkers. I think myself alone, crossing the waterlogged stretch between estuary and sea, looking only at the mosses, golden and fluffed up, threaded softly through the sodden grass. My eyes have been fixed low, but something causes them to rise. One small lift of the head and I have landed somewhere else, in another realm entirely, where time forgets to flow and birds are made of gold.I watch the golden plover on the ground before me, basking in the shining plumage. The brilliant sparks, scattered flames roaring in brown relief, seem to enact a special alchemy before my eyes – there is gold being made, here, in this living bird. When I am able to leave the speckled fire of the feathers, I look into its eyes. With its head tilted and slender build, it is not as cocksure as I would expect the owner of living gold to be. It is not quite sure what to do with itself, and nor am I. I could live in this moment for days.Instead, conscious of my looming size and lack of precious metals, I back away. Squelching down, my feet meet the water seeping in through old boots. Though I am flushed with sudden cold, I don’t react. My movements are small and quiet. The glowing bird looks on in silence. I cross over a runnel to the side and resume my walk with the water in between us. It seems satisfied with this arrangement and stays where it is. Walking backwards, I see its frame growing smaller as the surrounding sky increases, darkens. The only sun is on the ground; its flaming feathers break through the clouds.We watch each other for a long time. When it is out of view, I turn my head and let it drop once more, eyes sinking into soggy ground. Although the sun has gone, there are echoes still, trickling through the grass and buried low. I scan the submerged mosses, panning for gold. Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary","**Headline:** Escape to a Realm of Golden Beauty

78,Young country diary: it’s ‘Mary Berry’ picking season again,South Wales: It’s summer time and our gooseberry bush is full of fruit (and thorns) ,"The gooseberries are growing again. In Welsh they are called eirin Mair, berries of Mary, or “Mary berry” as my dad says. This year we collected about 200 of them from the bush in our small garden, about the same as last summer in lockdown. The ones we grow are green and have small spiky hairs on them which look strange. They taste really sharp when you eat them. We’ve made quite a few gooseberry fools with yoghurt, cream and icing sugar. It is one of my favourite desserts. I have also made gooseberry ice-cream.I scratch myself on the thorns of the bush quite a lot when picking them. Once after I did that, I wrote a short story about gooseberries causing an illness around the world when you ate them.

80,"Country diary: An unassuming chapel, full of death and life","Ayshford, Devon: It sits alone, tucked between canal and motorway, with centuries-old carvings that remind us of our mortality","The 15th-century chapel at Ayshford stands alone in a small, undulating field next to the Grand Western Canal. It is an unassuming building, facing slightly away from you as though preoccupied with other things, nudged aside by centuries of industrious human activity.In the early 19th century, engineers and labourers built the canal to ferry goods from Taunton to Tiverton. The canal never had a chance to live up to the grandeur of its title, cut short by the coming of the railways. The little village and the tiny stone chapel are now doubly bypassed, as the M5 thunders past, leaving this quiet stretch empty of traffic, bar the odd pottering moorhen or the Formula One flash of a kingfisher.The spring rain is fine and pervasive, so gentle it barely disturbs the pewter-grey surface of the water. We heave open the wooden door and step into the dry silence. The pews are stippled with dusty white splotches: tell-tale signs of bats in the belfry. Julia, whose family now owns the adjacent house and surrounding farm, sits down at the ancient organ and pedals it into life. It wheezes plaintively like a ghostly chorister.Ayshford Chapel has ‘tell-tale signs of bats in the belfry’. Photograph: Julia PoundIn one corner of the chancel is a huge stone tomb dedicated to the brief life of Henry Ayshford, who died in 1666 “aged one yeare and nine mo”. At the other end is another reminder of our mortality: an 18th-century stone carving of a reclining figure, now headless, cradling a skull. I take my phone out to click a picture, but the settings are wrong and I catch my own startled face in a selfie vanitas.The chapel still belongs to the Ayshford family, but is looked after by the wonderfully named Friends of Friendless Churches, a charity whose founders include TS Eliot and John Betjeman. Julia and her family are busy raising funds to repair the bell in time for the Queen’s platinum jubilee.Outside, the early flowers, known as spring ephemerals, have colonised the banks. Primroses, daffodils and violets make the most of their fleeting time before the trees come into leaf and gobble up the light.We walk back along the towpath through the soft rain, buoyed with renewed wonder at our ephemerality.

81, This article is more than 6 months old‘Definitely unprecedented’: Vermont wildlife also affected by historic floodingThis article is more than 6 months old,"Fish, beavers and skunks all suffered from the deluge this week. But good news: populations are healthy and they will rebound","The toll to wildlife from climate crisis-related weather events is an area that often gets overlooked in their immediate aftermath. But after the flooding in Vermont this week, previous weather calamities – including Tropical Storm Irene, in 2011 – can offer some clues.Fish in Vermont’s rivers, primarily species of trout – brook, rainbow and brown – have been found to move upriver during increased water flow to less turbulent areas, including tributaries or flooded fields, or find refuge behind fallen trees or rocks.Wolverines are the ‘embodiment of wilderness’. Can they make a US comeback?Read more“This is definitely unprecedented, but studies of smaller floods show that often fish are not displaced and are in the same pools before and after a flood,” said Will Eldridge, an aquatic habitat biologist with Vermont’s fish and wildlife department. “They can often survive in place by finding some refuge behind a structure or ride the edges of the flow up into the flood plain.”After Hurricane Irene, though, some fish populations fell by 50%, Eldridge says.“But the silver lining is that fish populations do recover pretty quickly, and they can do that because there is less impact in the headwaters and smaller streams, or they can migrate and recolonize areas that have been impacted,” he continued. “So we work hard to protect those headwaters and also provide connectivity between streams and systems.”Fish are not the only type of wildlife that get displaced. Eldridge’s wife noticed a number of displaced skunks in Montpelier in the immediate aftermath of this week’s flood. They had probably been nesting in the banks of the Winooski River and its tributary streams before they were flooded. Muskrats and weasels, too, were probably displaced.Our wildlife populations in Vermont are really healthy, abundant and sustainable, so they’ll be able to reboundTyler Brown of the Vermont fish and wildlife departmentOne of the most distressing sights around Montpelier in recent days have been the bodies of beavers hit by cars on the roads. Tyler Brown, a wildlife specialist with the department who specializes in beavers and runs the beaver baffle project, which helps to protect beaver-created habitats and studies how their dams can help slow flooding, says the Vermont floods this week will have displaced the beaver population – but only temporarily.“When we get this amount rainfall in so short a time it is likely that beavers will have been displaced from their dams because it’s not likely that a beaver dam could withstand that amount of water,” Brown says. “When it comes to normal thunderstorm-type flooding, beaver dams hold and add capacity for capturing water, and allow water to spill over into wetland areas and release it slowly.” But in a catastrophic flood like on Monday, he says, “it depends on where the dams are in the watershed.”While it is possible some beavers may have died in the flooding – there were reports of beavers swimming around during the high-water period of the storm – Brown predicts the overall population will be just fine.“Like humans, beavers are pretty resilient, so they’re likely already rebuilding to re-create their habitats,” he said. “We will just leave them be and let them figure it out. They know their habitat pretty well, so they’re going to move back to suitable sites in their wetland habitats where there are a lot of young trees – willows, alders, maples – to eat the phloem, or inner layer of bark.”Overall, wildlife populations tend to bounce back after flooding events while populations of bears, dear and turkey tend to move temporarily to higher ground.“Our wildlife populations in Vermont are really healthy, abundant and sustainable,” Brown emphasized, “so they’ll be able to rebound.”","**Headline:** Wildlife Rebounds After Vermont Flooding

82,How tide has turned on UK tidal stream energy as costs ebb and reliability flows,Investors are seeing rising potential in tidal power as turbines become more powerful and easier to deploy,"For decades the immense practical difficulties of harnessing the powerful tides flowing around Britain’s shorelines have put off investors and government officials searching for big renewable energy sources.But as the costs of deploying turbines in tidal streams fall, more and more people are seeing the potential in an energy source that creates energy as the tides ebb and flow at predictable hours every day – energy that is renewable but not intermittent.The cost of generating power from tidal streams has fallen by 40% since 2018 – and a report published last month by a government-backed research centre, Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult, forecasts prices could fall below nuclear energy in little over a decade, with one-megawatt hour of power due to cost as little as £78 by 2035 compared with £92.50 for the new Hinkley Point C power plant.Simon Cheeseman from the research center argues tidal stream energy is at the “point of commercialisation” as companies are keen to scale up production and deployment. But he says the sector still needs careful nurturing to ensure it follows the successful trajectory of offshore wind, which in 11 years has gone from generating only enough energy for 4% of British homes to generating enough for 33% of British homes. “In the early days of offshore wind, you had strong government support. This is the perfect blueprint for tidal stream energy,” he says. “There is no reason tidal can’t follow that same route.”Orbital Marine, which operates what it says are the world’s most powerful turbines below a plane-like floating platform near Orkney, has secured government funding to deploy three more floating turbines next year. Each platform can generate enough power for 2,000 homes and creates an estimated 100 jobs, according to the firm. “We want this to kickstart a real phase of change for us. We want to start manufacturing consistently and pull in more commercial investment,” says Andrew Scott, the company’s chief executive. “This is the first time in my 20 years in marine renewables that we’ve got a genuine chance of making tidal stream energy work commercially.”tidal power graphicAnother pioneering developer, Simec Atlantis Energy, is planning to install up to 56 turbines on the seabed at the northernmost tip of Scotland by 2027. “We’ve got the world’s largest tidal stream project off the coast of Caithness – 70% of the global tidal output has come from that site,” says Sean Parsons, the company’s external affairs director. “We’ve just won a government contract to expand that site from what is now 6 megawatts to take it all the way up to 34 megawatts – enough power for 68,000 homes. It’s tidal at scale.”Orders are even coming in from the rest of the world. “I’m feeling very excited about the industry and about what we are doing,” says John Meagher, director of business development at Nova Innovation, which operates seabed-mounted turbines off the remote Shetland Islands. “We are doubling the size of our Shetland tidal array from three to six turbines and we’ve exported our first turbine to Canada. We’ve won a feasibility study to look at the potential for an array [of turbines] in Indonesia. It just feels like things have really started to change.”An illustration of Orbital Marine’s underwater turbines. Photograph: Orbital MarineUnlike tidal barrages and tidal lagoons, which involve mounting turbines in sea walls, tidal stream turbines are lowered directly into strong tides out at sea. The challenges of installing and testing turbines in sometimes turbulent waters have made it far more costly than building wind and solar farms. But developers have been steadily refining their designs and driving down costs, with turbines becoming more powerful and easier to deploy at sea. “We are learning by doing: it used to take two days to connect up devices in the water but now it takes just two hours,” says Cheeseman.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But we know for certain when the tides come in and go out,” says Cheeseman. “It provides the energy buffer that you need in a system that will increasingly depend on irregular power.”Government support, however, has been patchy. Ringfenced funding was introduced in 2008 but scrapped in 2016, leading to the liquidation of some developers and restricting the industry to small-scale prototype turbines for five years. But at the end of last year the ministers allocated £20m worth of funding to the sector, under the government’s “contract for difference” scheme, which provides a guaranteed price for renewable energy. Four commercial-scale tidal energy bids, including two from Orbital Marine and one from Simec Atlantis, were successful. These projects are expected to deliver a near fivefold increase in the energy from British tidal power by 2027, upping the capacity installed from 10.4 megawatts to 51.2 megawatts.The government’s renewed faith in the sector is already attracting a surprising range of private-sector investors. “It was almost an impossible job to raise investment but since [the funding announcement] we’ve managed to get investment from major oil and gas providers and we’ve got an active inbound interest in equity investment right now,” says Scott.Nevertheless, problems remain. Unlike offshore wind, there is no official target for marine energy including tidal stream power, which is needed to drive investment. And the process of getting approval for underwater turbines can be extremely long-winded. It has taken Nova Innovation two-and-a-half years from gaining the seabed lease to being ready to install a turbine in Nova Scotia, Canada. But in the UK it can take more than twice as long to complete a tidal stream energy project, with everything from environmental impact assessments to grid connection causing delays. “From the word go … to actually putting turbines in the water, you are looking at six years – that’s a huge difference,” says Meagher.The tidal stream industry is growing once more. But there is no guarantee that ringfenced subsidies for tidal stream energy will remain in the next funding round, expected at the end of the year. “This is arguably the most important period,” warns Scott. “We’ve got proven technologies that are ready to be commercialised and growing export markets. If the government falls short in its commitment now, it could squander this incredible opportunity for the UK to become a world leader in tidal stream energy.” This article was amended on 24 November 2022. By 2027 British tidal power’s capacity will increase from 10.4 megawatts to 51.2 megawatts – not the energy created, as an earlier version said.","**Headline:** Tidal Power: A Promising Future

83, This article is more than 9 months oldReports of rotten pork being sold in UK may lead to tighter control of FSAThis article is more than 9 months old,"Therésè Coffey may bring Food Standards Agency, now overseen by health department, under remit of Defra","The UK government is considering tightening control over the Food Standards Agency (FSA) after news that allegedly fraudulent pork products found their way on to supermarket shelves.Therésè Coffey, the secretary of state for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), told the House of Commons on Thursday that she would look at bringing the FSA under her department’s control.An investigation by the trade publication Farmers Weekly found that until at least the end of 2020, one of the UK’s top food manufacturers had sold mislabelled and sometimes rotten meat to retailers.Meat produced by the supplier, as yet unnamed, is reported to have ended up in products such as ready meals, quiches, sandwiches and other produce sold in Tesco, Asda, Co-op, Morrisons and Marks & Spencer.The FSA, a non-ministerial agency overseen by the Department of Health and Social Care, which is responsible for public health in relation to food in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, has launched an investigation into the alleged supply chain fraud.The chair of the environment, food and rural affairs (Efra) select committee, Sir Robert Goodwill told the Guardian that having talked to the Farmers Weekly team behind the investigation, and read the reports, it was “obvious that the inspectors appear to have been misled by the company, which hid the suspect meat, sometimes in lorries or in other parts of the factory, during the time it took for the inspectors to have a cup of tea and put on their protective clothing on.”He added: “We could be looking at people going to prison because of how serious this all is.”Goodwill said he had “naively assumed was reporting to Defra but actually it was arm’s length and part of the Department of Health and Social Care, which tends to come to it from a health point of view rather than being closer to the supply chain as Defra would be.”Asked if a parliamentary inquiry might be launched into the supplier, Goodwill said inquires could take time but that a “one-day evidence session … with people from the FSA” was a possibility.Any full-blown inquiry might wait until investigations were completed, he said. “We don’t want to undermine the prosecution. But we [the House of Commons cross-party environment food and rural affairs select committee] will be discussing what course of action to take after the Easter recess.” Defra’s farm minister, Mark Spencer, said he had met the FSA and hoped it would deliver a criminal prosecution. “We will be keeping a close eye on the investigation,” he said. “And we’ll leave that with the Food Standards Agency to deliver a criminal prosecution.”Spencer said he would not make any further statement on Thursday because of the “ongoing criminal investigation” that involved “very serious allegations” that the FSA had a responsibility to investigate. Spencer said he was in regular contact with the meat industry and the FSA.The Farmers Weekly investigation found that tens of thousands of tonnes of foreign pork mislabelled as British had been finding its way into the supply chain each week. The supplier has been accused by former employees of regularly “washing” visibly bad hams in saltwater, and of mixing rotting pork with fresh product for further processing.On Wednesday, Darren Davies, the head of the FSA’s national food crime unit (NFCU), said the agency was “carrying out a criminal investigation into how a supplier was allegedly providing products labelled as British when they were in fact sourced from elsewhere.”Davies said the investigation was “complex” and that “all new lines of inquiry … including any potential food hygiene breaches at the premises” were being pursued. “If any evidence of a food safety risk is found, then necessary action will be taken,” he said.Last year, Davies said, the FSA “advised retailers … to check their cooked meat supply chain and to apply extra due diligence in their checks. We don’t give out these alerts without a reason.”Davies said the cost of living crisis could mean that food fraud increased as suppliers face pressure to turn a profit.
This article was amended on 30 March 2023 and 31 March 2023. An earlier version said that Robert Goodwill was Defra minister of state; in fact he is chair of the environment, food and rural affairs select committee. The original piece implied that the inspectors were from the FSA, but in fact inspections would be carried out by local authorities and the industry’s own auditors. It was further amended to reflect that Goodwill was asked about the possibility of a parliamentary inquiry, not a government inquiry.

84,‘We run from men only to meet crocodiles’: Kenya’s drought is deadly for women,"As poverty and lost livelihoods fuel threats in the home, those who have found refuge still risk their lives walking miles in search of water","The setting sun brings a warm glow to the huts in the village of Umoja in Samburu county, Kenya. Christine Sitiyan sits outside her home with her beadwork, carefully running the thin thread through tiny bead holes, hoping she can finish the colourful belt she is making before darkness sets in. The traditional belt can fetch 3,000 Kenyan shillings (£20), enough to cover her needs for a month.This tranquil scene is very different from her troubled past. Like many girls in her community, Sitiyan never finished school but was married off as a young teenager. Seven years later, with two children, she left her husband, unable to endure the beatings from a man she says could no longer fend for the family in an increasingly harsh environment.“He would beat me almost every evening out of frustration,” says Sitiyan, 25. “The drought killed part of his family’s livestock, while raiders from a neighbouring community stole the rest.” He took up manual labour, earning 300 shillings a day, barely enough to provide for the family. “One day, I just took off with the children and found refuge here.”Sitiyan is among scores of women and girls in Umoja, a village that has become a rescue centre for women and girls escaping domestic violence, female genital mutilation (FGM) and early marriages. There are no men in this manyatta, the traditional homestead.Christine Sitiyan, 25, found refuge in Umoja village after fleeing from her husband. Photograph: Peter MuiruriWhile the women may have escaped these threats, they are still potential victims of “drought-instigated violence”. Along with women in other marginalised counties such as Garissa, Marsabit, Mandera, Isiolo, Wajir and Turkana, they are at great risk of sexual molestation as they trek long distances in search of water.John Kitui, country director of Oxfam Kenya, an organisation that works with local groups helping to build resilience, says: “As the drought continues, families have nothing to fall back on and are forced to marry off daughters early to receive dowry payment. Without school fees, it is often girls who are forced out of class who then bear children at a young age. The resulting stress often leads to domestic violence.”Women are also the unintended victims of tribal conflicts as communities fight over dwindling resources. Men are forced to move remaining livestock tens of kilometres away to find foliage, and the women and children left behind are at increased risk of attacks by bandits.Men who are unable to cope with the drought take it out on womenHenry Lenayiasa, Samburu chiefA 2021 food and water assessment report for Samburu states that conflicts triggered by “competition for rangeland resources … have resulted in loss of people’s lives and their livelihoods”, with local leaders reporting increasing climate-related cases of domestic violence.Henry Lenayiasa, a chief in Samburu, says cases of violence against women by men who can no longer eke out a living in the harsh environment are on the rise. He says residents may have heard about climate breakdown and how it affects them, “but men who are unable to cope with the drought take it out on women”.“We have lost livestock in great numbers during the drought. In Kenya’s arid north, a man without livestock cannot provide and loses self-esteem. This is likely to trigger cases of domestic violence. If we do not address climate matters adequately, such cases will only escalate,” says Lenayiasa.A woman in Korr, Marsabit county, walks with her donkeys in search of water. Photograph: Peter MuiruriWomen in these marginalised communities are exposed to risk of attacks from other men and from wild animals as dwindling resources mean they have to travel farther from their homes to get water or firewood.“No place is safe for us,” Sitiyan says. “I was almost beaten up after some young men waylaid me on the way to the river, but I managed to escape. It is a risk we take daily in order to provide for our children.”For Sitiyan and the 38 women in Umoja, the nearby Ewaso Ng’iro River was their main source of water. But its flow has been interrupted by extensive droughts that at times left the river bone dry. A decade ago, Nasa’s Earth Observatory described the riverbed as “a pale tan ribbon of sand” after a prolonged drought in 2009. At other times, the river has flooded and displaced thousands. The river has little water currently, and what there is is contaminated by domestic and wild animal waste.Kenya rejects UN court judgment giving Somalia control of resource-rich waters Read moreOn a hot Thursday morning last week, the Guardian joined three women – Jane Nomong’en, Paulina Lekureiya and Kareni Lematile – for the 25-minute walk to the river. The unmarked route weaves through thick bushes. “This is where they hide,” Nomong’en says, pointing to a nearby thicket where a moran (young Samburu warrior) tended some goats. “There are no men in our village to protect us from the [troublemakers].” Along the route are several water pans dug in recent years to collect rainwater. It never rained.Left to right: Kareni Lematile, Jane Nomong’en and Paulina Lekureiya walked for close to two hours to find water. Photograph: Peter MuiruriA steep gulley leads us to the riverbed where the women find a spot with soft sand and hope it will yield some underground water. Lematile, the youngest, is tasked with scooping out the sand with a cup to make a hole wide enough for water to seep up. It is exhausting. She takes a break every few minutes while the others keep watch. “A 14-year-old boy was killed by a crocodile while fetching water up there,” Lekureiya says. “A woman was also attacked by a crocodile near the same spot. She was five months pregnant. We run away from men only to meet crocodiles.”It takes Lematile 20 minutes of scooping out sand before water begins to collect at the bottom. Using the cup, she painstakingly collects the water in four, 10-litre containers. This takes another hour. The women take a cupful each, and so does Lematile’s son. “We get some stomach upsets but what options do we have?” says Lematile.Kareni Lematile drinks the water dug up from the riverbed. The water can cause stomach problems. Photograph: Peter MuiruriAbout 100 metres away, a group of young men are scooping out large quantities of sand from the river to fill a truck and sell to developers, much to the chagrin of the women. Sand harvesting leaves the riverbed bare, unable to hold water during the dry season. It also results in floods during heavy rains. The women are afraid that if it goes on they will have to walk even farther to find water, exposing them to more risk of violence and attacks from wild animals.The women in Kenya’s arid areas know that their future security depends on political efforts being made far away this week at the Cop26 climate talks in Scotland, a country where turning on a tap brings instant water.“World leaders at Cop26 must deliver on promises to provide finance to these communities to enable them cope with the effects of climate crisis by addressing its root causes,” says Kitui.","# Climate Crisis: Women Pay the Price

85,ReviewWines for a warming world,"Ever-soaring temperatures are a challenge to wine makers, but these Mediterranean wines from forward-thinking vineyards and hardy grape varieties will be able to cope","Gallina de Piel Roca del Crit, Empordà, Spain 2018 (£19.99, butlers-winecellar.co.uk) This has been another exceptionally hot summer in southern Europe, one in which news outlets across the region have reported the record-breaking temperatures without any trace of Guinness Book-style wonder, just a kind of numbed certainty that the climate crisis is here to stay. Mediterranean winegrowers, their senses finely attuned to the tiniest of changes in weather patterns – changes they can taste in their wines as well as see and feel in their vineyards – have been in the advance guard of warning about climate change. And many have been asking which places, and which varieties, can remain viable as 40C+ temperatures become the norm. Some have looked for mitigating cool by planting at higher altitudes. Others, such as the makers of this gorgeous carignan-grenache blended red, seek out the moderating influence of the sea, and, in this case, the buffeting Tramuntana wind in their vineyards on and around the Cap de Creus peninsula just south of the French border.MIP Classic White Provence 2020 (£14.95, leaandsandeman.co.uk) The duo at the helm of the Gallina del Piel operation – which includes David Seijas, the former sommelier of Ferran Adría’s long-closed but lastingly influential Catalan three-Michelin-star restaurant, El Bullí – is more concerned than most with providing a clear indication of the vintage conditions. The colour of the cap sported by the bicycling chicken on the illustrated labels denotes the type of vintage. For 2018, the cap is red, which means an unusually hot, dry year. But the wine is very far from being hot or heavy: there’s an underlying freshness behind the aniseed and rosemary-scented red and blackberry fruit that is the result of careful winemaking, the seaside positioning of the grenache vines and the advanced age (up to 86 years old) of the carignan. There’s a similar combination of sun and strong moderating wind (“11 different winds!” say the producers) in the vineyards between the Mediterranean and the Ste-Victoire mountain that produce the fruit for the impressively expressive MIP dry white.Clos Colombu Tribbiera Rouge, Corsica, France 2018 (£17, Harvey Nicholls) The grape variety behind MIP White is vermentino, which has become increasingly popular across the Mediterranean and warmer parts of the New World in recent years thanks to its ability to retain freshness and brightness in hotter temperatures. Certainly the MIP has a lovely zip to it: there’s grapefruit and lime, but also more expansive tropical fruit and a satisfying balance between the mouth-filling and the mouth-cleansing. Vermentino is also the main white grape variety in the distinctive Italy-meets-France winemaking culture on Corsica, where leading producer Clos Columbu again makes the most of the moderating, cooling influence of the sea and the mountains in its vineyards above the Gulf of Calvi. The estate’s white (100% vermentinu) is a beautiful expression of citrus, stone fruit and herb; its red, a blend of the local sciaccarellu and niellucciu (aka Tuscany’s sangiovese) with a little of southern France’s syah, is vividly cherry-scented with notes of thyme and oregano and effortless succulent drinkability.Follow David Williams on Twitter @Daveydaibach","**Headline:** Climate-Conscious Wines for a Warming World

86," This article is more than 2 months oldInterview‘Steve Bannon is watching us closely’: Naomi Klein on populists, conspiracists and real-world activismThis article is more than 2 months oldMaya Goodfellow","Author speaks candidly about a ‘mirror world’ that feeds our anxieties, distorts reality and fuels the polarisation of society","Naomi Klein is aware that her new book, Doppelganger, looks strange. A distorted picture of her face stares at you from the front cover. “Everyone who holds it looks like they’re holding my severed head, including me. It feels like Macbeth,” she says. Her laugh punctures the quiet communal space we’re sitting in on the first floor of a London hotel in late September.But the weirdness is intentional. It’s supposed to capture what she’s writing about – a mirror world where her sense of self becomes distorted. Her starting point is her very own doppelganger, the writer Naomi Wolf. For more than a decade Klein has repeatedly been confused with Wolf. What at first irked her became more frustrating – destabilising, even – as it moved to social media and Wolf dived full on into conspiracy culture, allying with the far right in the process. The two are so frequently mixed up that social media algorithms began to autocomplete Klein’s name when people were writing about the latest thing Wolf had said or done.Best known for her writing and activism on corporations, disaster capitalism and the climate crisis, Doppelganger is in many ways a departure for Klein. More conversational and personal, it is funny and honest. Speaking softly on the other end of a sofa, in a rather grand book-lined room, Klein tells me one of the reasons for this is that she wanted to write in her own voice, not lean into some idea she had in her head of what a serious intellectual should sound like.View image in fullscreenIn Doppelganger, Klein writes about her sense of self becoming distorted.Her concern, though, was that it might be too specific; that the response would be “OK, that’s interesting for you but what does it have to do with me?” I wondered, too, when I heard the premise. But it works. Partly because it’s refreshing to read someone so established write with such candour about their insecurities, but also because many of the big themes of Klein’s work are still there.It’s tempting to focus on the Naomi Wolfness of it all, but she is just a case study. As well as being Klein’s doppelganger, she is also a doppelganger of herself. Once a prominent feminist and Democratic party adviser, Wolf is now aligned with the likes of Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon and has become part of what Klein calls the mirror world. This is where conspiracies are spread, where left critiques of corporate power are absorbed and twisted so “deregulated capitalism” is framed as “communism in disguise” and “where soft-focus wellness influencers make common cause with fire-breathing far-right propagandists all in the name of saving and protecting ‘the children’”.Klein analyses how the inhabitants of the mirror world have ended up there, including the allure of online clout and the payouts of the attention economy. But it’s also the anxiety created by the climate crisis. It isn’t only people who are becoming doppelgangers of their former selves, Klein says, the Earth is too – producing “vertigo on a planetary scale”. Where there were once woodlands, teeming with life, there are now nature-depleted farmlands, we are facing the possibility of a new mass extinction and people all around the world are breathing toxic air. It might not be “one of the conscious factors of what is making you behave in certain ways” but it “is a universal experience”: the “interlocking ecological crises” are part of why people feel despair, says Klein.The problem is that for some people, the mirror world speaks to these anxieties better than anything else. Not by seriously addressing the climate crisis but by playing on these feelings for its own ends – an authoritarian political project which is highly nationalist and has elements that are “explicitly fascist” (although not everyone is in the mirror world for this reason).View image in fullscreenA mirror world, writes Klein, is one where left critiques of corporate power are twisted so ‘deregulated capitalism’ is framed as ‘communism in disguise’. Photograph: Sebastian Nevols/The GuardianTake Bannon. “While most of us who oppose his political project choose not to see him, he is watching us closely. The issues we are abandoning, the debates we aren’t having, the people we are insulting and discarding.” And this focus on popular issues could be his ticket to the next wave of electoral victories, Klein warns.People like Bannon co-opt truths – such as how elites take advantage of emergencies for their own ends, one of the arguments of Klein’s The Shock Doctrine – and mix them with dangerous lies, such as the “great reset” conspiracy. They hijack and obscure the left’s arguments – tapping into people’s worries, they turn themselves into the vanguard of resistance, without offering any real alternatives to the “corporate predation” they rail against.Using conspiracy culture, they become the only source people trust, regardless of what they hear, read or even see themselves. One recent example, Klein says, is that a directed energy weapon caused the Maui wildfires. “Everything has to have an alternative story, it’s a great way to have an obedient base.”Naomi Klein’s doppelganger – podcastRead moreThe mirror world is not to be brushed off lightly. But what is important is to understand how we ended up here. It’s too easy to say people in the mirror world are the ones who “have no regard for material reality”, Klein says, and that “we are the people who are guided by truth and science when we all know we are in various stages of denial”. The “grotesque mockery and language and words that go on in the mirror world are only possible because of a generalised cheapening of words that is happening at the centre”. Politicians say they care about the climate crisis but continue subsidising fossil fuels and opening coalmines – she points to the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, who joined the 2019 climate strikers that were protesting against the policies of his very government.View image in fullscreenSteve Bannon, says Klein, watches the ‘issues we are abandoning, the debates we aren’t having, the people we are insulting and discarding’. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/GettyFor Klein, the mirror world tells us as much about ourselves as it does about the people we’re looking at. This goes for the left, too, where she suggests too much time is spent building personal brands. “I still care, far too much, about the image I am projecting into that world,” she writes of her anxiety about being confused with Wolf – acknowledging the irony given Klein wrote No Logo, “a treatise against the rise of lifestyle branding”. She asks us all to reflect: “What aren’t we building when we are building our own brands?”I can relate (though not to the doppelganger/internationally renowned writer part). Typing furiously online, sharing articles and videos, feels alluring and urgent but also self-indulgent and hollow. Klein says our online avatars make us less human, “less capable of changing and evolving, even in the face of pressing ecological and political crises”. This affects leftwing movements, which are in favour of inclusive and caring policies but do not always behave in those ways.Klein says one of the reasons the book is more personal than her others is that she didn’t want to chastise people. “It’s not me being outside of it shaking my finger. I’m saying I have a branding crisis, that’s pretty ironic. I’m concerned about the way this is impacting movements that I have been part of.”She recognises that in the capitalist economy, people can make money by creating these brands, and that some of us disappear into these personae because the world around us is overwhelmingly bleak. “We don’t know how to know. It’s too big; whether it’s our own complicity in labour abuses, or in extinctions or wars.”This is not a lamentation of the way things used to be, a one-dimensional argument about political polarisation or an apolitical plea to be kind to each other. Klein is encouraging us to be attuned to what is going on in the mirror world and to combat it by going back to first principles.“When you’re stuck in the realm of ‘this is their analysis, this is our analysis, they’re in the realm of conspiracy but we understand its capital’ … people don’t really know what to make of that, it’s all just talk … until you’re railing against the elites and you’re actually trying to materially take some money away from them and give it to workers.”View image in fullscreenMembers of the United Auto Workers union march through Detroit. The more ‘real-world activism’ there is, says Klein, the more counterfeit populism is denied power. Photograph: Matthew Hatcher/AFP/GettyPointing to automobile workers on strike and tenant organising in the US, she says the more real-world activism there is, the more counterfeit populism is denied at least one of its sources of power – some of the others being white supremacy, toxic nostalgia and patriarchy. “One of the wellsprings is that people are really mad at elites, and that’s one we can do something about – give people the real thing.”Klein says Doppelganger is not an exercise in “I have figured out the left, come follow me” – it’s one contribution to the creative work that’s needed on climate and the other interconnected challenges of our time.Still, all of this is dizzying. We are, after all, meeting as part of a promotional tour for her book, featuring her face on the front and with her ideas in it. Klein tells me how the front cover came into being, which involved a very last-minute search for something that captured the bizarreness of the book and bringing the cover designer of The Shock Doctrine and This Changes Everything out of retirement (he’s now a fiction writer). “At a certain point you have to defer to good design,” she says, “but I admit that it’s full of contradictions.”She doesn’t bristle when I ask about it. She did say earlier in our conversation that she was trying to hold herself a “little more lightly”. It’s important we all try to do this, she argues, because if we’re going to deal with the weight of “the vast, complex planetary crisis”, we can only do that together.

87,"My Cyclone Diary: after the flood, the dread that replaces panic","In the second instalment in a series of diaries about Cyclone Gabrielle’s aftermath in New Zealand, Anna Rankin describes the fears, rumours and unexpected effects of a lack of internet in the town of Wairoa

My Cyclone Diary: The day we watched the flood swallow Wairoa
","It is difficult to record historical events that will in time determine policy decisions and economic outcomes, and the lives of those affected, while events are still unfolding. There are the quick impressions – men wrestling escaped bees on a roadside deep in flood waters, a flattened cornfield marked by the shape and force of the torrent, a mud-soiled child on a stoop, wide plains transformed into lakes, the eerie chime of a stuck train signal. Then there are the pecuniary matters – the financial loss of a corn yield – and the interviews with the afflicted.Any large-scale traumatic event, be it a natural disaster or a war will often provoke reminders of previous traumatic episodes; instances that have remained abstract, placeless or locked within the mind. A flood might breach other instances of grief, loss, degradation, violence. It may be the interminable and sour stench of silt and sewage, children’s toys and clothing heaped in brown puddles, humble and cherished items stacked in ruins or the ceaseless clack of helicopters flying low through ashen skies that prompt the return of a painful memory; it could be the sight of broken walls, sagging houses, a wrecked car submerged in mud.Buried by mud and silt, New Zealand’s farms face ‘10-year recovery’ – picture essayRead moreThe national state of emergency in Hawke’s Bay and Tairāwhiti has been extended for a third week to manage the ongoing impact from the flooding event, and for many these past three weeks have been a gruelling blur of endless toil, more rain accompanied by anxiety at a greying sky, sheltering at a marae or elsewhere for an indeterminate period. People speak of the collective trauma that accrues among those caught in limbo, living in close quarters together. A different mode of anxiety settles in, there is a shift in psychology. Dread supplants the immediate panic where, for instance, the week after the flood, water was scarce. Town faucets supplied water only an hour or so a day, and there remains circumspection about the quality of that water. The river as it breached roared through fertiliser plants, farm run-off, garden sheds stacked with hazardous chemicals, and sewage.A flood-damaged house in Wairoa. The New Zealand town was cut off for three days after Cyclone Gabrielle ripped through the region last month. Photograph: Brennan Thomas/The GuardianFour days after the flood, the local council administered its usual daily update – printed on A4 paper given the lack of telecommunications – with a decree to boil all water. All flood water was to be treated as contaminated as the wastewater system was overloaded. Three days after this edict, the update instructed those wading through sludge and silt to wear gloves and long sleeves, and respiratory masks for those blazing days where the mud dried to dust and curdled in the throat, prompting wheezing and a caustic taste in the mouth. Those intervening days between ordinances were, then, higher risk, regarded as more unsafe than was previously understood. Such details are important in consideration of the seeds of distrust planted and circulating within communities during the Covid pandemic. Formal warnings or lack thereof threaten to reinforce mistrust in such a time.The immediate ancillary social issues to the event were not unanticipated – the spike in domestic violence, the sole operational grocery store stating it would not sell alcohol and cigarettes, the fear of theft. “Good job on the yellow stickers,” one man rued, wryly addressing the council in describing the classification that signals a house is not immediately habitable but not condemned and may therefore contain valuables. There was the fraying mental state of those on the frontlines confronting destroyed homes and distressed occupants, tasked with issuing such stickers that sealed the fate of a home’s inhabitants.That there was, for a week, no internet connection allowed for a markedly different experience than might otherwise have transpired. The centre of the town became atypically populated; people converged on the council grounds seeking information, supplies, conversation, hopes of an online connection. It would have been an entirely different experience had there been the internet to scroll for information. There would not be the knitted community that would emerge, the material understanding that our lives are indivisibly linked to one another, notwithstanding the observation levelled from some corners that those milling around the grounds were not – for the most part – covered in mud, were not salvaging their ravaged homes, and it would become, and remain, a point of contention. Comments would be directed at the council and the National Emergency Management Agency, which located water reserves, food and social services on the side of town that had not experienced flooding.A hotel and bottle shop in Wairoa.

Photograph: Brennan Thomas/The GuardianWith no fuel, those on the affected side of town could not necessarily travel to access water with which to clean or drink; when they arrived at a food bank for welfare boxes, they found those reserves scant or emptied. Occupied with urgently rescuing their ruined homes, they were dealt a further blow. Military vehicles rolling through the town and reserves clad in fatigues became a familiar and ambient sight; the sound of choppers collecting and depositing relief and supplies – power generators, water, food – a hopeful if not disquieting brace against the sense of being abandoned. And there were those on far-flung farms or on the outskirts of town also without fuel and supplies, and those still without power, three weeks on.‘Like a tsunami’: the role of forestry waste in New Zealand’s cyclone devastationRead moreA week or so into the disaster it seemed as though half the town was quite suddenly stricken once again with Covid, including the mayor and the primary volunteer leading the response effort at Hinemihi marae. The abrupt confluence of a pandemic and a natural disaster is a modern crisis of the kind theorists and scientists have been predicting for decades. Accordingly, facing twinned events under such conditions prompts ethical and practical questions and problems, and risks, that will ultimately depend upon an individual, not the state, to weigh and to make commensurate decisions and compromises.What this event has offered is a glimpse not only into the daily realities faced by many around the world – how the impoverished and stricken have lived for decades – but a future that has arrived in all its chaos: lack of water, intermittent power, no communications, dwindling, limited or restricted reserves of fuel and food, uninhabitable homes, sudden unemployment, destroyed infrastructure and road networks. The notion of the social contract is removed from its theoretical status in such a time; how thin are those strands that bind us together when the grocery store shelves are bare and no banking technology means those with no cash will go without but for the goodwill of others – particularly when central government cannot intervene at the outset. That requisite moral and ethical choices are required is patent but there is no guarantee one will act in accordance with one’s system of belief under such duress.

88,Hunger and hope: Africans tell of desperation and innovation as climate summit meets ,"As delegates in Nairobi debate the havoc that climate crisis has wreaked on the continent, we speak to people finding new ways to feed themselves in Kenya, Uganda and South Africa","African heads of state, ministers, leaders and campaigners are meeting this week in Nairobi for the first climate summit held on the continent. An estimated 30,000 delegates are in the Kenyan capital to debate and lobby governments to keep their commitments to support the people suffering the worst consequences of the climate crisis while contributing the least to its causes.Africa has been hard hit by climate-related extreme weather, fuelling a severe hunger crisis affecting millions. We speak to people about living on the frontline of the crisis in three African countries, and what can be done to mitigate some of the problems.KENYA‘Only God can help us ’: a father laments rising food pricesSitting pensively inside the makeshift shed that serves as his grocery shop, Florencio Okonyo explains how, for close to three decades, he has bought fresh vegetables and other household items at discounted prices before selling them for a slim profit to residents of Lindi village, part of Nairobi’s sprawling Kibera slum.When business was booming, Okonyo, 69, would take home “one or two thousand Kenyan shillings” (£5-£10), which was enough to feed, clothe and educate his four children.Not any more. Dwindling supplies of fresh produce from Toi, the main market in Kibera, means he is unable to restock his stall. Today, only a few oranges, each selling for a paltry 5 shillings, are available; the proceeds are too meagre to feed the family.‘We can’t afford three meals a day’: Florencio Okonyo at his flagging grocery stall in Kibera, Nairobi. Photograph: Peter MuiruriHigh food prices have forced Okonyo to drop rice and milk from the family menu. Half a kilogram (17oz) of rice and 500ml (a pint) of milk sell for 60 shillings each.“We cannot afford three meals a day,” says Okonyo, pointing to a plastic jug of tea that serves as his lunch. “The price of everything has gone up. I just make enough to buy a 2kg packet of maize flour. We even stopped eating bread for breakfast, opting instead for mandazi [cheap fried bread made in the slum].” In Nairobi, a loaf of bread sells for 65 shillings while mandazi sells for 5 shillings a piece.Between March and July, residents largely drawn from Nairobi’s “informal settlements”, as the slums are known, took to the streets to protest about the high cost of living. Okonyo feels disillusioned that nothing came out of those protests. “People only transferred their problems from the house to the streets,” he says.“We hear the government and opposition leaders have agreed to talk, but we are told the rising cost of food is not among the items on the table. Ni Mungu tu [only God can help us now],” he says.‘For a woman, this is economic liberation’: climate-smart farmingWhen Maria Mwiti moved to Mutunyi village, near Isiolo, 20 years ago, she wanted to succeed as a vegetable farmer. But Isiolo is a largely arid region in northern Kenya where 80% of land is “non-arable and used for grazing”, according to a climate-risk profile by Kenya’s agriculture ministry.“It was all bush and dry,” she says. “Wild animals roamed the area, making farming difficult.”Undeterred, Mwiti tried planting maize but harvested nothing as elephants, zebras and warthogs from nearby wildlife conservancies ate her crop before it could mature. “We could not get anything to eat. We fought off the elephants day and night. We were risking our lives,” she says.Ten years ago, she fenced off her parcel of land to keep the animals away, then planted tomatoes on a 2,000 sq metre (half-acre) plot of land, using rainwater collected upstream and brought to her farm through gravity. But water levels were drastically reduced due to the climate-induced drought that has devastated the Horn of Africa for the last four years.“We were advised by our local community project manager to use drip irrigation rather than fill trenches within the garden with water, which was in short supply. Drip irrigation means you only water the specific seedling with regulated amounts. A changing climate has forced us to change our farming methods,” says Mwiti.‘I used to be hired but now I can hire’: Maria Mwiti tends her tomatoes on her farm near Isiolo, Kenya. Photograph: Peter MuiruriShe has been attending farming seminars in the agricultural heartland of central Kenya to learn about best farming practices, including the right use of pesticides. The nearby Lewa wildlife conservancy helped her analyse her soil to determine the best tomato variety to plant.“I resorted to planting a fast-growing hybrid tomato that yields more. I used to harvest four crates twice a week but have since doubled the amount, earning 4,000 shillings a crate, up from 1,500. I can earn 300,000 shillings [£1,600] in a good season,” says Mwiti.She and her family can now buy food from the proceeds of tomato farming. She also has 11 cows that produce up to 60 litres of milk a day. She still plants maize, but for use as silage to feed the cows.“Without the climate-smart agriculture, my family would still be food insecure,” she says. “I would keep on asking for handouts from my husband.“I used to be hired, but now I can hire five women in a day to help me on the small farm,” she adds. “For a woman, this is economic liberation.” Peter MuiruriUGANDA‘We share the little we have’: scratching a living from the landJosephine Nantongo’s home is a monument to survival. On her tiny plot in Kabaganda, a suburb of Kampala, she tries to rear goats, rabbits and chickens and grows bananas and vegetables. It is the only way she can survive in the face of rising food prices in the Ugandan capital.“I could have given you entula [the Thai round eggplant also known as “garden eggs”] to take home but the rains were delayed, and they all died out,” she says apologetically as she uses a stick to poke avocados from a tree before sitting down to dinner with her family. Dinner is silver fish, also known as mukene, and cassava.“Today is a good day,” she says. “Sometimes, when my business has not worked out, we simply take porridge and go to bed.”More than four months of harsh sun has made her vegetable plot dry up. Her chicken died of disease and, two months ago, thieves broke in and stole her goats.Nantongo goes from house to house selling clothes. Every day, it becomes more difficult to knock at people’s doors. “Nobody has money any more. Even the people I could have sold to are struggling. We used to buy 12 pieces of matoke [plantain-like green bananas] at 1,000 [Ugandan] shillings [21p] but now we only get eight for the same amount,” she says.“Just a few months ago, a kilogram of posho [maize flour] was at 2,800 shillings. Now it is nearly double that.”‘Today is a good day’: Josephine Nantongo eats a meagre dinner with her children. Rising food prices and an erratic rainy season have left them on the breadline. Photograph: Patience AkumuThe UN World Food Programme’s monthly market monitor for Uganda indicates that, for major food items such as maize flour, prices are far higher than at the same time last year. For instance, the average price for beans in July is 45% greater than July 2022.“Sometimes the neighbours have nothing to eat, and we must share the little we have,” says Nantongo, as she dips a piece of cassava into silver-fish stew and gives it to a child who has wandered into the house with her two-year-old daughter.If a neighbour has a good harvest of potatoes, she will bring it home and share with everyone within the fenced compound. If a relative from the village visits and brings fruit, it would be unjust to eat the fruit alone, knowing your neighbour might be hungry, she says.Nalongo Gloria, who owns the nearby grocery shop, understands the predicament of her neighbours well. “When everything fails, you go to Nalongo and get some food on credit,” Nantongo says. “Then you pray to God that you find the money to pay for it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Global DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He is the headteacher of Jubilee community secondary school in Karenga in north-eastern Uganda’s Karamoja region, which has for decades registered high levels of poverty and food insecurity.Last year, Dominique received a lifeline: the school received a grant from the Novo Nordisk Foundation and World Food Programme to expand the small garden where it grew orange-fleshed sweet potatoes into a plot big enough to feed both the school and wider community.“Orange-fleshed sweet potatoes were an easy option,” says Dominique. “They are nutritious, drought-resistant and take only three months to mature.“We knew that everyone would be able to grow some at home, rather than faraway gardens, and the plants would be safe from wild animals. These potatoes do not need a lot of land.”Students, teachers and a healthy crop of sweet potatoes at the Jubilee community secondary school in Karenga, Uganda. Photograph: Patience AkumuThe potatoes, fortified with vitamin A, which boosts immunity and improves vision, are now grown on more than 3 hectares (8 acres) of land. The school recently built an irrigation system to ensure they can harvest all year.Students plant and tend the potatoes, and operate the irrigation system themselves. Another 3 hectares of school land is used to grow potatoes they sell to the community, and a smaller plot is used as a nursery for replanting potato vines.When there is plenty of rain, usually in March and April, the school can harvest 10 bags of potatoes a day – enough to feed the entire school and leave a surplus. School staff boil the fresh potatoes and serve them with beans, and use the boiled potato leaves as a green vegetable. Surplus potatoes are dried in the sun and stored for the dry months when the harvest is leaner.“There was a time when there was no rain and no food for months, but the sweet potatoes survived and so did we,” says Dominique.“Our focus is now on teaching our children how to grow these potatoes because we know that at home there is [sometimes] no food. It is important that children learn resilient methods of farming.” Patience AkumuSOUTH AFRICALaid off at work: ‘Now it’s bread for breakfast, lunch and dinner’It’s 10am, and Christabell Mhurushomana, 40, pours herself a glass of Mazoe orange cordial, then sits on the couch in her apartment in Tembisa township, just outside Johannesburg. The loaf of bread on the table in front of her could be her only meal today if she does not land a house-cleaning job.‘I can no longer afford decent food’: former store manager Christabell Mhurushomana at home near Johannesburg. Photograph: Silence CharumbiraBefore June 2022, Mhurushomana was a manager at a local chain store and could afford any food she wanted. She was laid off when the company downsized and now survives on menial household jobs in Midrand, a suburb of the city.Why rich nations must pour climate funds into Africa – for all our sakesRead more“I can no longer afford to buy decent foods like meat – the best that I can do for protein is eggs,” says Mhurushomana, a widow with two children. “Even the bread I now eat costs just 6 rand (25p) and it must be my breakfast, lunch and dinner for two days unless I get money to buy mealie meal [ground maize] and eggs or vegetables,” she says.On a good day, she makes just 350 rand, but such good days are rare. With a kilogram of beef now costing at least 90 rand (up from about 50 rand a year ago), Mhurushomana makes do with whatever she can afford each day.And when it comes to work, she must compete with close to 100 other women who are in a similar position and going after the same jobs.‘We could beat climate change’: the rise of regenerative farmingOn his farm, Danie Bester talks with passion about the techniques that have doubled his yields while slashing costs. He took up “regenerative” farming on Rietbult Estates farm, about 60 miles from Johannesburg, a decade ago and believes it could be the answer to the climate crisis for farmers.‘Yields have doubled’: Danie Bester with a radish grown using regenerative farming methods. Photograph: Bongani Siziba“Education [and] improved uptake of regenerative farming could beat climate change,” says Bester, from Mpumalanga province in eastern South Africa.Regenerative farming is about preserving the land naturally by keeping soil covered and disturbed as little as possible, replacing artificial fertilisers with manure and animal urine, and diversifying crops.Since making the transition in 2012, Bester says his maize, soya bean and sunflower yields have nearly doubled, while the costs of farming inputs have drastically fallen.South Africa, like many other African countries that rely heavily on agriculture, had its most brutal drought in three decades in 2014 and 2015. With temperatures continuing to rise and rainfall patterns shifting due to the climate crisis, Bester thinks it is imperative to educate farmers and encourage more of them to shift to this new method.A recently harvested maize field at Rietbult Estates, showing a cover crop that is left to grow naturally to protect the soil. Photograph: Danie Bester“With regenerative farming, you get a more productive soil because it retains more moisture and enhances its ability to feed the crops. There is exponential reduction of inputs because the soil starts to provide better fertility on its own. For the last decade, my maize yields have grown from 4.7 tonnes to 11 tonnes per hectare,” says Bester.Other costs have also been reduced: Bester once used 450kg of fertiliser a year for his land but now needs only 280kg. “There are so many advantages, including immense moisture retention.” This, he adds, is vital, “with big droughts increasingly likely every other year”.

89, How to turn England’s rivers from filthy sewers into shining streamsRachel Salvidge,"None of our rivers meet the legal standard for health, and communities are starting to take matters into their own hands","I wouldn’t go swimming in England’s rivers, in the same way that I wouldn’t flush my head down a public toilet. It’s not just me who feels this way. Even Sir James Bevan, the chief executive of the Environment Agency – the regulator responsible for protecting and improving water in England – has said he would be “cautious” about it, first seeking out assurances by checking the websites of the EA and the campaign group Surfers Against Sewage before going for a paddle.Bevan’s agency does provide some assurances – as long as you only wish to swim in one of the country’s 417 or so designated bathing water sites, most of which are at the coast. In fact, there are only around a dozen inland bathing lakes in the whole country; and, for now, just one river – in Ilkley, West Yorkshire – which was rated “poor” in the agency’s last assessment of bathing water, so you might want to avoid it anyway. Better to hop across the Channel instead, where France can offer around 1,300 glorious lakes and rivers designated for safe swimming among its 3,300 bathing sites.The main reason Defra, which sponsors the EA, is loth to greenlight river swimming is that sewage, farm, urban and industrial pollution is so widespread that all of England’s rivers failed to meet the legal standard for overall health the last time they were assessed. It’s not the EA’s fault though, according to the agency. It has pleaded poverty over the abysmal state of our watercourses, stating that “you get the environment you pay for” and calling for more government funding to enable it to nobble polluters and do its job properly.So where does that leave the wild swimmers, the boaters, the anglers and pretty much anyone who would prefer to stroll alongside a shining stream than an open sewer? Sensing abandonment by the agency – compounded by its recent moves to stop attending “low-impact” pollution incidents and the low morale of staff who say they are no longer able to deter polluters – communities have begun to take matters into their own hands. It appears, at first glance, as though it is working.It began last year when the people of the Ilkley Clean River Group in West Yorkshire succeeded in getting a stretch of the River Wharfe, already popular with swimmers, designated as an official bathing water site. Situated downstream of a sewage treatment works, the group knew the water would not be safe and concluded that a bathing designation was the only way to oblige the Environment Agency to install a water quality monitor and acknowledge the level of pollution there. After a bizarre scrap to get the agency to locate the monitor downstream of the sewage works rather than in the cleaner water upstream, that stretch of the Wharfe officially became the first river bathing water in England, albeit one with poor water quality.A year on and we now have a grand total of two river bathing sites: thanks to the efforts of the Thames21 charity, a stretch of the River Thames in Oxford will also be granted bathing water status next month.France we are not, but could these two sites signal the first green shoots of a wider society-led movement to clean up our rivers?The Rivers Trust and Surfers Against Sewage (SAS) campaign groups hope so. Together they’ve compiled a map showing 273 popular river recreation spots, including some where there is already community interest in setting up a bathing water designation, such as Warleigh Weir on the River Avon and Sheep’s Green on the River Cam. SAS has also launched a petition calling for Defra to create 200 new bathing sites by 2030.Bagging a bathing water site is relatively straightforward, according to Thames21. For anyone embarking on the process, it recommends convening river users, picking a popular spot with access and facilities, researching pollution risks, logging the number of people using the river during the May-September bathing season, getting the landowner’s permission, raising public awareness and then making a formal application to Defra. It sounds simple, but Prof Becky Malby from the Ilkley Clean River Group points out that there is no transparency over Defra’s decision-making and that it takes around two years to complete the whole process – time which, in their case, would have been better spent fixing sewage spills from the nearby water firm’s pipes.This is what ‘cutting red tape’ gets you: rivers polluted without consequence | John VidalRead moreSo we’re in (at best) muddy waters. Clearly, the growing bathing water movement is positive and the associated public awareness is critical if things are to improve, but it doesn’t get anywhere near addressing the problem of chronic and widespread river pollution. A couple of Environment Agency tests for two types of bacteria taken at one site during the bathing season doesn’t even begin to scratch the surface of the number of pollutants flowing through our beauty spots, or the consequent risks to people and wildlife.What we need are wholesale improvements to entire catchments made by tougher regulation of the biggest polluters: the water industry and agriculture. A few bathing designations on a river in a catchment that is inundated with sewage pollution or choked by farm fertilisers will not be enough to make swimming safe.

90, ‘They look like waves’: spider webs blanket Gippsland after Victorian floods,"Flooded roads and paddocks disrupt local spiders which seek higher ground on road signs, trees and any tall grass they can find","Residents in eastern Victoria have been taken aback after waking up to vast, alien-like sheets of spider webs laying across paddocks and roadsides.The East Gippsland town of Traralgon was one of the hardest-hit areas by recent flooding and wild weather. While its neighbour Sale avoided the brunt of the damage, flooded roads and paddocks disrupted the local spider populations, which are now seeking higher ground on road signs, trees and any tall grass they can find.“It’s just incredible, when they blow in the winds they look like waves,” said Jena Beatson, who saw the spiders on her first trip into Sale from Longford after the roads were cut off by flood waters.“It does look creepy the way it covers all the signs and everything. You can’t really see it in the photos but there are spiders all over. It’s like thousands and thousands of spiders.”Actually, according to Dr Ken Walker, a senior curator of entomology at the Melbourne Museum, it is millions.Allow Facebook content?This article includes content provided by Facebook.

Spiders can make a wide range of different silks and one of the silks they use for this behaviour – ballooning – it’s a very, very thin little silk that they use … to fly away with the breeze. They could fly 100km,” he said.“What’s happened is there’s been a massive flooding event pretty quickly … so they’re using the ballooning not to escape for hundreds of kilometres but to almost throw up a lasso on top of the vegetation. It hooks on to the tops of the vegetation because it’s lighter than air, and then they quickly climb up.”

When a huge number of spiders all do this at once, they end up hooking on to each other and can blanket the countryside.This phenomenon, sometimes called the gossamer effect, is caused by “vagrant hunter” spider species, which live on the ground and do not build a web. They also do not create webs after ballooning away from a flood. In fact, Walker said, each spider only threw up a single thread, meaning every tiny line of silk represented a different animal.“I would say millions of spiders [in the photos online],” he said.Allow Facebook content?This article includes content provided by Facebook.

We just normally don’t see them because they’re under vegetation, on the leaves, under bark and things like that,” he said.Thousands of spiders, including the red and black Ambicodamus species, have created large webs after the Victoria floods.

91,After the fall: what a garden might look like at the end of the world,"‘Post-apocalypse’ is not a typical theme for a garden show, but in Melbourne, landscape architects planted out a climate change worst-case scenario

Get our weekend culture and lifestyle email and listen to our podcast
","Abandoned by humans, no longer inhabitable, a typical suburban Melbourne home sinks into a marshland – perhaps it was caused by flooding, or rising sea levels. A wild entanglement of vegetation creeps around and over the built structures, a forest of self-seeded garden escapers.Or that’s the plan, anyway. At this stage, the exhibit is not so much a garden as a construction site from a builder’s anxiety dream. On 31 March, it will be ready for the Melbourne International Flower and Garden Show in Carlton Gardens. The installation, titled Coming Soon, is a showcase garden by Akas Landscape Architecture and Nrth Landscapes, exploring a possible future for Melbourne’s suburban yards.The corner, and only the corner, of a weatherboard house is tilted jauntily over a pile of bluestone rubble – volcanic basalt, the characteristic bedrock of Melbourne’s lava plains in the west and north. Over the next week, hundreds of potted trees, shrubs, and grasses will be moved in, tucked under soil and mulch to suggest a garden abandoned for decades.The garden designers Ryan Parker, Anthony Sharples and Alistair Kirkpatrick. Photograph: Ellen Smith/The GuardianThe exhibit was planned for the 2020 show, and then delayed twice due to Covid-19. Yet it looks eerily like images from the devastating recent floods in Queensland – close enough that another exhibitor called it “a little bit in bad taste, considering what’s going on”.“Well, I think it’s in very bad taste for the government not to act on climate change,” says Akas co-director Alistair Kirkpatrick, with a touch of acerbity. He’s joined by other co-director, Anthony Sharples.So which plants have they chosen as likely survivors of a climate catastrophe that forces humans to flee?“A lot of the plants that we have in there are already really commonly used garden plants, which was intentional,” says Sharples. “Native, indigenous [native to the Melbourne region] and exotic plants – we wanted to use all three. If the landscape is left to its own devices, plants are going to form a new ecology. We’re going to have so many houseplant escapees, and so many different types of plants meshing together. All the plants that we’ve chosen, we’ve seen actually growing in abandoned gardens in Melbourne.”Australian native violets that are planted in the garden. Photograph: Ellen Smith/The GuardianTrees like silver dollar gum (Eucalyptus cinerea), gingko (Ginkgo biloba) and coastal tea tree (Leptospermum laevigatum) will be packed thickly over typical council-approved shrubs and grasses like lomandra (Lomandra longifolia) and miscanthus (Miscanthus oligostachyus). The heaviest shade will provide shelter for tender carpet bugle (Ajuga reptans) and native Australian violets (Viola hederacea). And there’s a smattering of old-fashioned favourites like ginger lily (Hedychium gardnerianum) and lamb’s ears (Stachys byzantina).Kirkpatrick suggests that the distinction between “native” and “introduced” plants might not always hold up to close scientific scrutiny.“Dr Angela Moles did this incredible study on Arctotheca calendula [cape dandelion], a South African weed. She’s found that it was so genetically divergent from its South African counterpart, that from a scientific perspective, it actually was an Australian native species. So I think we need to move beyond that binary.”Meanwhile, Nrth Landscaping are finishing up the new-old house, a process that’s required some creative problem-solving.To create the effect of peeling paint, landscaper Ryan Parker coated brand new boards with slippery lanolin, then painted without waiting for them to dry between coats – everything you’re not supposed to do. On the roof, carpenter Danny hammers rusty roofing nails at deliberately odd angles.The result is uncannily decrepit.The house’s corrugated iron roofing and sash window were found in salvage. Photograph: Ellen Smith/The Guardian“We just bought all these materials in the name of sustainability, so we’re kind of contradicting ourselves, but as long as they can be hacked out and [we can] do it again in a way that can be unveiled and unpacked and taken to somewhere …” Parker shrugs.In fact, the weatherboard is one of few things bought new for the project, with the house’s corrugated iron roofing and sash window found in salvage.As sustainable gardens grow more popular, clients are more open to recycled materials, and prefer a less rigidly controlled aesthetic.“A lot of people will say that they want to go out into their garden, they want it to feel like their own little oasis, and they want it to feel overgrown,” says Sharples.But it’s a difficult balancing act: when sustainability is in fashion, it runs the risk of being reduced to an aesthetic. What can gardeners do to make sure sustainability is more than a vibe?Sharples’s answer is immediate: build a pond.“Water is the heart of the garden. It keeps the space cool. It brings animals and biodiversity into the garden.

Photograph: Ellen Smith/The GuardianWhat about renters, and people in small spaces? Is it possible for me to have a water feature on my tiny balcony, I ask?“Yes, absolutely!” says Sharples. Any large, wide-mouthed vessel that holds water, he says, can be a pond, provided it’s big enough for fish (to keep down mosquito larvae), and aquatic plants (to keep the fish happy). But even a simple bird bath can be a lifeline for birds and native bees on hot days.

Australian ecosystems have changed rapidly; an introduced plant might now provide a critical resource for native animals, especially if native food sources or nesting sites have decreased. Dense shrubbery is especially important for small native birds.Ultimately, the team hope the exhibit inspires people to build not just fish ponds, but political momentum.“If we don’t have radical action on climate change immediately,” says Kirkpatrick, “this is what’s coming soon.”“And the world will be fine.

92, Treasury blocking green policies key to UK net zero target,Experts say chancellor refusing to commit spending needed to shift economy to low-carbon footing,"The Treasury is blocking green policies essential to put the UK on track to net zero emissions, imperilling the UK’s own targets and the success of vital UN climate talks, experts have told the Guardian.A string of policies, from home insulation to new infrastructure spending, have been scrapped, watered down or delayed. Rows about short term costs have dominated over longer term warnings that putting off green spending now will lead to much higher costs in future.The UK’s credibility as host of the Cop26 climate talks this November in Glasgow rests on a clear net zero strategy – but publication has been postponed until near the eve of the summit, giving the UK little leverage to bring other countries to the negotiating table with the tougher carbon targets needed. Meanwhile, steep cuts to overseas aid have severely damaged the UK’s standing internationally, experts on the UN talks said.Jamie Peters, director of campaigning impact at Friends of the Earth, said: “The Treasury has been helping to fuel the climate emergency for far too long. The reality is that a rapid transition to a zero carbon future would be far less expensive than delaying the green measures we so urgently need, and that will create significant economic opportunities and new jobs.”Civil society groups, thinktanks and political insiders said the Treasury had refused to commit to the spending needed to shift the UK’s economy to a low-carbon footing. Complaints about the potential short-term costs of net zero policies have been one flashpoint during weeks of high tension between the prime minister, Boris Johnson, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, the Guardian understands.Once you understand the terrible cost of doing nothing, climate action is a bargain | Damian CarringtonRead moreKate Blagojevic, head of climate at Greenpeace UK, said: “There are strong reports that Rishi Sunak is intent on blocking climate spending at exactly the moment we need it most, and that his fingerprints sit heavily on moves to delay or block crucial investment to cut emissions from buildings or gas boilers.”The lengthy charge sheet against the Treasury includes: scrapping the green homes grant insulation scheme; freezing fuel duty while slashing electric car incentives; mulling cuts to air passenger duty on domestic flights, while making above-inflation train fare increases; failing to cut VAT on green home refurbishment; underfunding the new infrastructure bank; and delaying the phasing out of gas boilers.There have also been glaring omissions and delays. For instance, the transport strategy failed to back road pricing, which many believe will be essential to reducing emissions, which have remained stubbornly high as more people buy SUVs. Both the hydrogen strategy and heat and buildings strategy have been delayed until autumn, as has the overarching net zero strategy.Not all of these policies were under direct Treasury control, but the Treasury holds the purse strings and can effectively veto plans by other departments that require government investment or might raise costs for consumers. “The Treasury is at the root of this,” said Ed Matthew, campaign director at E3G, a green thinktank. “They are completely obsessed with short-term costs. It’s bonkers.”Chris Venables, head of politics at the Green Alliance thinktank, said: “The Treasury has this huge institutional resistance to medium term economic benefits [that entail short term costs]. They have to be dragged kicking and screaming to consider it.”Ministers and advisers are understood to be anxious that costs such as switching to heat pumps from gas boilers, estimated from £5,000 to £20,000 for some households, or the higher purchase price of electric cars, will hurt consumers’ pockets. But the independent committee on climate change has said the costs of net zero are affordable and falling, at about 1% of GDP by 2050, while green investment will generate new jobs, and policies can be devised that shift the costs from lower-income households and distribute them fairly.Moreover, as this week’s report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change spelled out, extreme weather is already here and will get worse. As recent flooding has demonstrated, the costs of inaction will far outweigh the costs of action.Even observers normally sympathetic to the government find the Treasury’s reluctance concerning. Josh Buckland, author of a report for the liberal conservative thinktank Bright Blue, said: “The Treasury is absolutely crucial to net zero. It has taken some welcome steps thus far to drive green finance and investment, but the jury is still out on how far it is willing to go given wider pressures on the public finances.”Buckland, a former environmental adviser to Johnson, believes that Sunak, known to be a fiscal “hawk” and free-marketeer, is not ideologically opposed to climate action. He said that while the Treasury was traditionally reluctant to commit spending on any issue, Sunak “also has a lot of priorities as we recover from the pandemic”.Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, disagrees. “Their ideology is standing in the way – they think that it can be done by the market and it can’t. They are held back by thinking this can all be done by the private sector, when all the evidence is that this has to be done by the public and private sectors.”Recent calls by Conservative MPs including Steve Baker and Craig Mackinlay to halt the race to net zero, which have received a warm welcome in sections of the press, have suggested that some MPs may also sniff electoral advantage in being seen to be anti-green.Scientists issue a climate code redRead moreBlagojevic said: “The chancellor’s position may be politically expedient for him in trying to court the small number of Tory MPs intent on delaying climate action. Ultimately, though, history will not look kindly if he is the chancellor who tried to hobble our chances of reaching a low-carbon future, with all the growth, good jobs and stable better future it offers.”If the UK is to meet its net zero targets, ministers will have to face down backbench critics. E3G’s Matthew said: “It’s becoming understood [by the government] that you can’t just leave it to the market to deliver net zero, as that isn’t going to happen. For a Conservative government, that’s an inconvenient reality.”Last year, as the world was plunged into recession after the first lockdowns, Johnson appeared to grasp this when he promised to “build back greener”. Since then, however, few spending plans to reduce emissions have been brought forward, other than the green homes grant. Johnson also produced a 10-point plan setting out areas of focus, including nuclear power and offshore wind, but this was dismissed by many experts as a wishlist rather than a strategy.The Treasury said: “The government is committed to tackling climate change and the prime minister has set out an ambitious 10-point plan to help us achieve that. The Treasury is playing a crucial role in this effort, by allocating £12bn to fund the 10-point plan, setting up the UK infrastructure bank to invest in net zero, and announcing plans to issue £15bn in green bonds over the next year.”As the UK prepares to host Cop26, the government will be trying to persuade other countries to set out clear policies on emissions cuts for the next decade, a task much harder if ministers have no policies of their own. Ultimately, says Venables, only one person can sort this out: “The prime minister needs to get stuck in, to make the difficult decisions, and soon.”","**Headline:** Climate Action: Essential for a Sustainable Future

93, China’s top climate official urges US to ‘clear barriers’ to talks,"US-China relations hit new low this year after Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, over which China claims sovereignty
 Cop27 live – latest news updates","China’s top climate official has said the US must take responsibility for any reconciliation between the two countries at the Cop27 climate summit, calling on the US to “clear the barriers” to talks.Xie Zhenhua, the climate envoy for China, said he had met John Kerry, the US special presidential envoy for climate, in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, where governments and world leaders have gathered for a fortnight of talks on the climate crisis.He said: “It is the responsibility of the US. We hope the US will take the initiative, to clear the barriers. I think the door was absolutely closed by them. We in China are trying to open it.“We have already started informal conversations with the US. We, with John Kerry, have a joint effort to support the Egyptian presidency, and have a successful Cop27.”Relations between the world’s two biggest emitters hit a new low this summer after the US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, visited the disputed island of Taiwan, over which China claims sovereignty. The diplomatic deep freeze has cast a shadow over the already fraught climate talks.Both sides have made conciliatory remarks, but there is still no formal rapprochement. Before Xie spoke to a small group of mostly Chinese media on Wednesday, Kerry told an event: “I’ve spoken, but we’re not having any formal meetings. You know I’ve made the argument to the Chinese publicly, I’ll make the same argument to you today, it’s nothing different.“This is not a bilateral issue. It’s a global threat to the planet. And we need to be talking to each other because we’re the two biggest economies in the world and we’re the two biggest emitters in the world. And we have a common interest in working together to try to reduce emissions and be leaders on this level. So the answer is: I’ve said to China many times publicly, and President Joe Biden has indicated to them, that we are open to resuming climate [talks] and hope that we’ll be able to.”Xie and Kerry have previously enjoyed a productive relationship. Last year at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow, the pair unveiled a surprise pact to cooperate on cutting emissions, including ways to reduce the potent greenhouse gas methane.Xie said: “But just as everything was going well, Nancy Pelosi invaded Chinese sovereignty, and hurt the Chinese people’s feelings. That was against the spirit of the joint communique [signed at Glasgow].”Xie also hinted that China was “supportive” of developing country attempts to ensure a flow of funds to help them with the loss and damage they suffer from the climate crisis. Loss and damage, which refers to the devastation wreaked on vulnerable countries by extreme weather, is one of the most contentious issues at the talks. Poor countries have accused the rich of causing the climate crisis while leaving them to bear the brunt of the damage unaided.China could participate in helping to fund efforts in other developing countries, Xie said. “There is not an obligation on China [to contribute funds] but we are willing to make our contribution … China has already been doing that, [providing] help to other developing countries. Our attitude [to loss and damage] is very supportive and understanding.”He also praised the “inclusive and constructive attitude” towards loss and damage at the talks. “We strongly support the concerns from developing countries, especially the most vulnerable countries, for addressing loss and damage because China is also a developing country and we also suffered a lot from extreme weather events,” Xie said, speaking through a translator. “It is not the obligation of China to provide financial support under the UNFCCC.”A senior developed country diplomat told the Guardian that Xie’s words should not be interpreted as indicating China’s willingness to pay into a formal loss and damage fund, of the kind that developing countries are demanding.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The UK said it would allow some debt payment deferrals for countries hit by climate disasters, while Austria and New Zealand put forward funding for loss and damage, which is the cost of rebuilding in poorer nations after unavoidable climate impacts.For the US, Kerry unveiled a new voluntary carbon trading market scheme with the aim of boosting private investment in clean energy projects in developing countries. Kerry said the new initiative, called the energy transition accelerator, will be created in partnership with the Rockefeller Foundation and the Bezos Earth Fund to help deliver trillions of dollars of investment.For many of the countries that require climate finance, one of the key issues emerging at Cop27 has been calls for reform of the World Bank. The Guardian asked the president of the bank, David Malpass, whether he denied the science of climate change. He was unwilling to respond.World leaders had largely left the conference by Wednesday afternoon, leaving their negotiating teams to continue the talks into next week. There are still divisions between developed and developing countries over how to approach loss and damage, but participants said the talks were going well.","**Headline:** Climate Talks at Cop27

94," This article is more than 1 month oldSellafield nuclear site workers claim ‘toxic culture’ of bullying, sexual harassment and drugs could put safety at riskThis article is more than 1 month old","Exclusive: Multiple sources warn poor working culture heightens risk of accidents, suicide and sabotage

UK nuclear police and workers share WhatsApp jokes about paedophilia, racism and homophobia
Sellafield nuclear site hacked by groups linked to Russia and China
","A “toxic culture” of bullying, sexual harassment and drug-taking risks compromising the safety of Europe’s most hazardous nuclear site, multiple employees at Sellafield have claimed.More than a dozen current and former employees have alleged to the Guardian that the Cumbrian site, a vast dump for nuclear waste, has a longstanding unhealthy working culture, where staff have been bullied, harassed and belittled, with some apparently pushed to suicide.The site’s human resources department has been accused of taking a “bully, break, bribe” approach to dealing with employees who raise concerns over their colleagues and site safety.Sellafield whistleblower: ‘employees said it was not safe to speak out’ - videoWhistleblowers warn that the toxic culture could have dangerous consequences for safety and security at Europe’s biggest nuclear waste dump, which hosts decades of radioactive material. The revelations have emerged as part of Nuclear Leaks, a year-long Guardian investigation into cyber hacking, radioactive contamination and toxic workplace culture at the 6 sq km (2 sq mile) site.A whistleblower, Alison McDermott, a consultant who said she was sacked in 2018 after raising concerns over Sellafield’s culture and sexual harassment, warned that this climate heightens the risk of not just accidents and mistakes, but also terrorism and sabotage.“Those risks are far more likely to materialise if you’re working in a highly toxic and dysfunctional culture,” she claimed.The vast taxpayer-funded site employs 11,000 staff, who are tasked with making safe crumbling buildings containing nuclear waste. It is one of the biggest employers in the north-west, with generations of the same families working there.The investigation into Sellafield has found:
Several suicides apparently linked to the pressures of working at the site.
A former young worker who claimed he was bullied to the point where he “just wanted to die” after he was repeatedly mocked over his sexual experience.
Workers who alleged they have either experienced or witnessed incidents of sexual assault.
Staff who allegedly regularly bring cocaine on to the site and keep samples of untainted urine in case of random drugs tests.
A 2020 report published by the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR), which monitors the site, warned that an unhealthy work culture played a part in the biggest-ever nuclear disasters, including Chornobyl in 1986 and Fukushima in 2011.The report stated: “The role of organisational culture in maintaining nuclear safety is well established: reports of investigation into notable events such as Three Mile Island, Chornobyl, Davis-Besse and Fukushima provide compelling evidence of the importance of establishing an effective nuclear safety culture.”Sellafield is one of the dominant employers in the west Cumbria region, together with BAE Systems, which makes Britain’s nuclear submarines in nearby Barrow-in-Furness, paying salaries that are typically higher than the regional average. Generations of families are heavily dependent on Sellafield for work and sources said that alternative employment is difficult to find for those who leave after attempting to raise concerns.Sellafield is one of the dominant employers in the west Cumbria region. Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianIt is understood that several suicides have been linked to the pressures of working at the site in recent years.Sources with knowledge of medical services at the site claimed that there have been a disproportionately high number of severe mental ill-health episodes, suicides and suicide attempts among the workforce.The wider Cumbria region has a suicide rate that is 50% higher than the average in England. While there is no official data on the number of suicides linked to the site, a source claimed the rate at Sellafield is even higher. Sellafield declined to confirm whether it has records of suicides among its employees.“You have to consider Sellafield and the surroundings in the same way you might an army base and its host town,” said a source with medical knowledge of the site. “The level of risk of suicide or intense mental ill-health in hothouse conditions like this is higher, as any issue at work is also a social issue in an area like this. People often feel they can’t escape.“Sellafield workers are a high risk group for suicide, and the numbers, while too small for statistical analysis, suggest that it has an outsized suicide and mental health problem for its worker population.”Some current and former staff say they have felt the sense of being in a “goldfish bowl” where they are unable to leave the site behind in rural communities after finishing their working day.There are also concerns over claims of bullying. A source who began working at a young age for a contractor on the site has described how colleagues routinely “picked away at me to find out my biggest vulnerabilities”. In a written account, seen by the Guardian, the young worker said he was called a “virgin”, a “faggot” and a “pussy” and was mockingly given the name “top shagger” as colleagues speculated about his sexual experience.“My confidence sunk to an all-time low and they made me feel that I wasn’t worthy of being a human being and I just wanted to die,” he wrote. “It’s now almost four years on – I am not even close to recovering physically and mentally.”He also alleged that colleagues would regularly bring cocaine on to the site and that some “even kept samples of their urine in case of a drugs test”.Several other sources at the site have questioned the effectiveness of the drug testing regime at the site.Last year, it emerged that seven workers tested positive for drugs after 741 workers were randomly tested between November 2021 and November 2022.There are also concerns about allegations of racist, misogynistic and other troubling behaviour at Sellafield. In late 2020, a network of ethnic minority employees wrote to the company’s board, listing 27 alleged racist incidents.A senior industry source said that a hardcore of longstanding Sellafield employees who are resistant to change are known as “We Bees” – short for “we be here when you be gone”.A former employee said: “There is zero staff turnover, and often three generations of the same family are working on site. Everyone sees it as a job for life and it is a very insular community. When you are trying to change that mentality it is very difficult and challenging.”Multiple sources described the response from the human resources department to those who spoke out as “bully, break, bribe”. Sellafield did not comment on the allegation.In a report prepared for the NDA in 2019 by consultants at PwC, and seen by the Guardian, one employee said: “I feel like I’m punished by HR when I stand up and report bad behaviour.”Alison McDermott alleges she was fired after telling managers that an investigation should be carried out into sexual harassment claims. Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianMcDermott, an experienced HR consultant who has consulted for a range of blue-chip organisations, was brought in to identify issues with Sellafield’s culture and make recommendations. However, she alleges she was fired after telling managers that an investigation should be carried out into claims of sexual harassment and a subsequent cover-up. She is awaiting a decision on her case from the court of appeal after a lengthy legal battle with Sellafield.McDermott said: “The gravity of the bullying and harassment and the abuse employees were being subjected to was just really shocking and off the scale and there clearly was an endemic problem with bullying and harassment at Sellafield.”McDermott, an equality consultant, has spoken to scores of current and former employees before and after she was let go in 2018. She raised concerns over claims of sexual harassment by an employee and allegations of a subsequent cover-up at Sellafield.“Employees said to me that because it was not safe to speak out that they had learned just to keep their heads down and look away just to survive but a survival mentality is not what you want at a nuclear plant because even one mistake, just one mistake, can set off a chain of reactions which could have catastrophic consequences – as we’ve seen with Chornobyl.“Trust is the cornerstone, it’s the absolute bedrock of safety in any organisation – if employees are demoralised and scared to speak out or are being treated really badly then it will have a direct impact on safety.“The risks at Sellafield, they’re not just confined to the risks of an accident or a mistake – as serious as that could be – there are other really serious risks at Sellafield such as acts of terrorism, or even deliberate sabotage. And obviously those risks are far more likely to materialise if you’re working in a highly toxic and dysfunctional culture.”She added: “[The legal battle] has cost me financially and impacted my health.”In a 2018 report of a call to the Safecall whistleblowing hotline, a manager was accused of sexually harassing women for several years. “This has been covered up and not actioned,” the employee claimed.In response to a freedom of information request, Sellafield said it had spent £724,481.82 in the past five years defending employment-related matters.Email anna.isaac@theguardian.com or alex.lawson@theguardian.comA Sellafield spokesperson said: “There is no place for bullying and harassment at Sellafield. We do not tolerate it and where we find it, we take action. If anyone has information related to employee misconduct we urge them to come forward so we can investigate.“We’re committed to ensuring all of our employees are respected, included, and able to perform at their best.“We regularly seek the views of our workforce, and it was a survey in 2018 that brought focus to concerns about bullying and harassment.“We confronted the issue, proactively shared information with employees, and developed a company-wide improvement programme. This work is continuing, and we remain as committed as ever to eradicating unacceptable behaviour from our workplace.“Since 2018 we have implemented a number of improvements including increased resources for mediation, counselling, and our confidential employee assistance line. We also have a wide range of employee-led networks which provide peer support and advocate for change and improvements.”Sellafield declined to comment on McDermott’s case. It has previously said that her claims are “entirely without substance” and noted that an appeal against the findings of her employment tribunal upheld its original ruling.An ONR spokesperson said: “Sellafield is the most intensely regulated nuclear site in Britain and we undertake several hundred inspections and engagements every year.“We have found no evidence that cultural issues have resulted in unsafe activities on the site. However, we are not complacent and will continue to scrutinise Sellafield closely to ensure that safety and security remain their highest priorities and are not compromised by any factors, including internal culture and behaviours.”Claire Coutinho, the secretary of state for energy security and net zero, wrote to the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority which owns Sellafield on Tuesday after the Guardian’s investigation into the site. She requested a “urgent” update on efforts to fix any concerns about its workplace culture.

95, I used to fly around the world in all-expenses-paid luxury – but I couldn’t face my conscienceCarlton Reid,Quitting flying as a travel writer was easier than I expected. Now for the hard part: convincing my family to do the same,"As a travel writer, I’m used to receiving invitations to five-star resorts in far-flung destinations such as the Seychelles, all expenses paid. But now I ignore these emails. I quit flying three years ago. I’m not afraid to fly; I stopped because of the climate crisis. In addition to travel, I write about green issues, and I decided I could no longer in good conscience specialise in sustainability while continuing to fly.I was a late convert to the cause, taking a plane to Israel in 2020 to write about a Palestinian cycle advocacy group. A trip like that would be off limits to me today, even if peace broke out any time soon. It’s all but impossible to reach Israel from Europe without flying. It’s almost as tough to reach the Antipodes from the UK without a long-haul flight, so bang goes a quick-ish trip to New Zealand or Australia.I could still get to North America if I waited for one of the monthly crossings on Cunard’s Queen Mary 2 to New York from Southampton, but I couldn’t get there in a rush: there and back would take two weeks (and tickets for paying travellers start at around £1,000, one way).Quitting flying has undoubtedly shrunk my world. But I still do long-haul trips within Europe, using high-speed trains and slow-speed sleeper services. I also take to the water: I’ve written up train-and-ferry trips to Malta, Sardinia and Ibiza. I also crossed the Dover Strait on a test sail for a proposed wind-powered catamaran ferry from Dover to Boulogne.And, somewhat surprisingly, my work hasn’t suffered. Without flying, I’ve still been able to file copy from the European Commission in Brussels, penned business stories from the Tour de France’s visit to Denmark and swanned around Sweden on a press launch for a new electric car. When I reported on the opening ceremony of the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow in 2021, I cycled there from Newcastle. When I had to go back for the summit’s closing, I took the Caledonian Sleeper train from London.But for all this eco street cred, I can’t help but feel I am a lousy flight-free advocate because I’m yet to convince my family to follow suit. Last year, my wife flew to Madeira without me (there are no ferries to the island), and at the time of writing this piece, our three millennial kids were on separate flight-based holidays in Belgium, Dubai and Greece.When I moan, ever so gently, about their chosen mode of (planet-trashing) travel, they point out I’m a hypocrite because – and it’s true – I have spent a lifetime flying. Piqued by my holier-than-thou snarks, they argue I am in no position to lecture them. That is a fair point, and I put it to Maja Rosén, co-founder of We Stay on the Ground, who has not flown since 2008 and coordinates the worldwide “flight-free” movement.“We need to be cutting emissions now,” she told me, but she couldn’t conjure an argument that worked with my family. “There are so many ways to explore the world without flying,” she tried, which is true, but that cuts no ice with those with itchy feet who can’t afford the sky-high prices of long-distance train travel.Scrawled bits of paper and an A-Z: How I went cold turkey on Google Maps | Ned VesseyRead moreTravelling by train instead of flying is also deemed by many to be “virtue signalling”. There’s even a new Swedish word for this: tagskryt – “train bragging” – to describe how some people, myself included, crow about their long-distance journeys by train when others fly. Because it’s quick, cheap and egalitarian, flying remains the done thing.Might the digital nomad argument – the notion that you can work on trains – cut through? Probably not, and it’s oversold anyway. For all my ambitious plans to bang out article after article when travelling by rail, I tend to doom-scroll in much the same way I’d do up in the clouds. And the views from a train might be captivating in daylight, but rolling through Schleswig-Holstein at night is just as dull as traversing it from 30,000ft above.I’m left with the best reason for not flying: it’s simply better for the planet. Yet, for all the evidence that flying is bad for our long-term survival as a species, those who seek to restrict jet-setting are seen as party poopers. So be it. I remain happy that I kicked the habit, but I can’t deny I miss the idea of travelling to far-flung destinations only accessible by plane. My solution: I’ve trained my inbox to junk the invitations.

96," Seven in 10 Australians want government to take more action on climate, survey finds",The Lowy Institute’s annual survey of sentiment on climate action found strong support for net zero emissions by 2050 and a ban on new coalmines,"The Morrison government is under increasing pressure to act on the climate crisis, with a new poll showing seven in 10 Australians want the Coalition to lock in stronger commitments in the lead-up to this year’s Glasgow summit.The Lowy Institute’s annual survey of sentiment on climate action finds strong domestic support for Australia committing to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and majority support for a ban on new coalmines.The findings appear to undercut resistance from some prominent members of the Nationals, who have publicly cautioned the government against making a net zero commitment and have been pushing for a continued embrace of coal.Biden administration says Australia needs to cut greenhouse gas emissions soonerRead moreThe Lowy Institute-commissioned poll of 3,286 Australians found overall concern about climate change had increased over the past year, with 60% of respondents describing global warming as “a serious and pressing problem” and agreeing “we should begin taking steps now even if this involves significant costs”.That represented a four-point increase from 2020.In the latest climate poll, a majority (55%) also said the government’s main priority for energy policy should be “reducing carbon emissions” – an eight percentage point increase since 2019.That compares with 32% of the sample who said the priority should be reducing household bills – a decline of six points over the same period.Reducing the risk of power blackouts – a key focus of the government’s messaging on the issue – was nominated by just 12% of respondents as the energy policy priority in the most recent poll, down three points.With the government facing international pressure to endorse deeper emission cuts in the lead-up to the expanded G7 summit in June and the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in November, the poll finds strong domestic support for doing so.When presented with a question about the forthcoming UN climate negotiations, 70% agreed that “Australia should join other countries, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, to increase its commitments to address climate change”.That compared with about three in 10 respondents (29%) who chose the alternative statement that “Australia should continue with its current policies to address climate change”, while 1% said they did not know.Some 78% of those surveyed said they would support a net zero emissions target by 2050 – an idea Scott Morrison has expressed as a “preference” rather than a formal commitment – while 20% said they would oppose it.Just over six in 10 Australians said they would support a ban on new coalmines opening in Australia, while the same proportion said they would support reducing Australian coal exports to other countries. Just 30% of the sample would support providing subsidies for building new coal-fired power plants.The director of the Lowy Institute’s public opinion and foreign policy program, Natasha Kassam, said the politics and economics of climate action were shifting and a number of elected officials “would take heart” from the results.Kassam said the level of support for moving away from coal would not have been seen several years ago. She noted that 70% of Australia’s coal and gas exports went to countries in Asia that had set net zero commitments.“We’ve seen Australians’ concern about the climate increase since 2012,” she said, while noting there had been a slight dip in the poll last year when “understandably much of the public was feeling pretty anxious about the pandemic”.“What has really shifted in the last couple of years is the willingness of the public to bear costs for climate action … and now we can see the vast majority accept benefits outweigh the costs.”When asked to weigh the consequences of acting on climate change, nearly three-quarters of the respondents (74%) said the benefits of taking further action would outweigh the costs, while about a quarter (24%) said the costs would outweigh the benefits.‘No action on anything’: Australia increasingly isolated as US and others ramp up climate ambitionRead moreOther popular potential policies include providing subsidies for the development of renewable energy technologies (91% support) and providing subsidies for the purchase of electric vehicles (77%).With the government pursuing its so-called “gas-fired recovery” from the pandemic, and planning to spend up to $600m on a new gas-fired power plant in New South Wales, 58% of the sample said they would support increasing the use of gas for Australia’s energy generation.And seven years after the Abbott government repealed the Gillard government’s carbon price after a relentless political campaign, some 64% of the sample said they would support an emissions trading scheme or a carbon tax.The Lowy Institute said its climate poll was based on a nationally representative online and telephone survey conducted by the Social Research Centre between 12 and 26 April, with a margin of error of about 1.8%.The Sydney-based thinktank has been tracking attitudes to global warming since 2006, when 68% of respondents agreed that it was “a serious and pressing problem” requiring Australia to take steps even if it involved costs.That dropped to a low of 36% in 2012 at the height of the acrimonious political battle over the Gillard government’s carbon pricing scheme, before steadily rising in subsequent years.","### Climate Action: Australians Demand More

97, This article is more than 4 months oldWednesday briefing: Fukushima nuclear plant is set to flush tonnes of water into the sea – but is it safe?This article is more than 4 months old,"In today’s newsletter: Japan’s decision to release radioactive water from the tsunami-hit power plant has divided groups – is it entirely safe or staggeringly stupid?
 Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition","Good morning.Today’s newsletter comes to you from Manchester, original home of the Guardian (est 1821), and me, Helen Pidd, your friendly north of England editor. I’ll be writing the daily briefing alongside Nimo for the next few weeks.Our latest edition concerns events in Japan 12 years ago, when a huge earthquake struck off the country’s north-east coast, triggering a tsunami that caused the worst nuclear disaster since Chornobyl.More than a decade later, the clean-up continues at Fukushima. This week the Japanese government announced that work will begin on Thursday to pump more than one million tonnes of water into the sea from the destroyed Daiichi nuclear power plant, in a move that has prompted horror from environmental groups and consternation in neighbouring countries.Is it madness to pollute the Pacific Ocean with enough tainted water to fill at least 500 Olympic-sized swimming pools?I spoke to the Guardian’s Japan correspondent, Justin McCurry, as he packed his bags to return to Fukushima, saying that he had no qualms about drinking the local sake and how the area has become a surfing hotspot once more.In depth: ‘Plants pump diluted tritium into the sea all the time and nobody bats an eyelid’An activist holds a placard at a protest in Seoul against the planned release of wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant into the Pacific Ocean. 22 August 2023. Photograph: Anthony Wallace/AFP/Getty ImagesOn 11 March 2011 a magnitude 9.0 earthquake triggered a tsunami that knocked out the backup electricity supply at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant on Japan’s north-eastern Pacific coast, leading to meltdowns in three of its reactors.Ever since, 1.34m tonnes of radioactive water has accumulated at the site, according to the plant operator, Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco). This includes liquid used for cooling, plus rain and groundwater that has seeped in.Earlier this year, Justin visited the site, and saw the thousand or so steel tanks being used to house the contaminated water (pictured above). “They’re three storeys high and are all together across a wide area,” he said.Tepco says it will soon run out of storage room and this week was granted permission to start releasing “treated” water from the tanks into the Pacific Ocean.The plan has caused controversy because the water contains tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen that can’t be removed by the facility’s water filtration technology.It will not be pumped out all at once, but over the next 30 to 40 years. The first discharge, starting on Thursday (weather permitting) will total 7,800 cubic metres over about 17 days, Tepco said. For those of you not great at visualising volumes, that’s about three Olympic swimming pools.Is it dangerous?The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has approved the discharge, saying that the radiological impact on people and the environment would be “negligible”.The levels of tritium will be 1/40th of the legal level for discharges, Tepco insists, and has promised to upload hourly data on water quality. The scientific consensus has persuaded Justin that “as long as you are exposed to tritium in low doses, it doesn’t represent a threat to human health”.Greenpeace, however, has described the filtration process as flawed, and warned that an “immense” quantity of radioactive material will be dispersed into the sea over the coming decades. Concerns have also been raised by the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), the main intergovernmental organisation representing the region, which has been consulting with Japan over the release for the past two years and in January said it had “grave concerns” over the plans. In June, the PIF issued a statement drawing attention to international laws against dumping nuclear waste in the Pacific.Justin has come to the view that storing the water indefinitely is not a realistic option: “When does it end? What are you going to do with 2m tonnes, 3m tonnes? What about a leak? That area gets tsunamis, it gets quakes, it gets typhoons. What if something like that were to happen and lots of the tanks were damaged?”But much remains unknown. Justin asked a “very sensible” anti-nuclear expert if it would be safe for him to go swimming in the sea in Fukushima in September. The expert said yes, but that the problem is not swimming but “organically bound tritium – over the years, when it gets into seaweed, shellfish or fish and then consumed by humans over a long period. What does that do to human health? It’s difficult to say.”The falloutSurf’s up on Iwasawa beach in Naraha, Fukushima prefecture, Japan. Photograph: Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty ImagesSome of Japan’s neighbours are very unhappy. Hong Kong – the second-largest importer of food products from Japan after mainland China – said it will ban “aquatic products” from 10 Japanese prefectures. That includes the capital Tokyo, as well as Fukushima itself.Last month, Chinese customs administration threatened a blanket ban on all foodstuffs from the same 10 areas.Though South Korea’s government has given Japan its blessing, many residents are panicking, with reports that some people are stockpiling sea salt.Justin says there is an element of hypocrisy there. “Nuclear power plants, including those in South Korea, and China, pump diluted tritium into the sea all the time and nobody bats an eyelid.”China, he said, saw the controversy as a “very useful stick with which to beat Japan at the moment”.Japanese fishers are understandably worried about the damage to their reputation. So too are the marine-related tourist businesses which have started to reopen in Fukushima.Next month Justin is due in Fukushima again to cover an international surfing festival. Having visited the area on numerous occasions since 2011, including at least six visits to the wrecked power plant itself, he has no worries about his health on his latest trip.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

","Authorities are continuing the search for a tiny radioactive capsule lost along a 1,400km stretch of Western Australian desert highway.The 8mm by 6mm capsule fell from a secure device on a truck that was travelling from a Rio Tinto mine site, north of Newman in the Pilbara region, to Perth, where it was being sent for repair.According to WA authorities, the capsule was packaged on 10 January, transported offsite on 12 January, and the casing it was contained within arrived in Perth on 16 January. It wasn’t until nine days later, on 25 January, that it was discovered missing when the package was unpacked for inspection.Search stepped up for potentially deadly radioactive capsule lost in Western AustraliaRead moreWA’s Department of Fire and Emergency Services on Monday said radiation specialists were searching along the Great Northern Highway by “driving north and south directions at slow speeds”. The department said earlier it was using radiation detection equipment that could be fitted to vehicles in the search.What is the capsule used for?The missing capsule is a 19-GBq (gigabecquerel, a unit of radioactive decay) caesium-137 ceramic source, commonly used in radiation gauges. Caesium-137 is a radioactive metal with a half-life of 30.05 years – meaning in three decades it will have half of its original activity. It emits beta and gamma radiation.In the missing capsule, the caesium is bound in a “ceramic matrix” rather than existing in a loose powder form. The caesium-137 is encapsulated by steel, which prevents beta particles from penetrating through.

The general manager of Radiation Services WA, Lauren Steen, said capsules like these are commonly used industrially as fixed radiation gauges, which measure the density and flow of materials. They are widely used in the mining, and oil and gas industries.“What they look at is the rate of flow or level in a pipe,” Steen said. The gamma rays emitted by the caesium-137 penetrate through the pipe and are picked up on the other side by a detector.Steen said a radioactive source like the missing capsule was typically designed to be left in place for a lifespan of about 15 years, with yearly regulatory checks.The small, round and silver capsule containing radioactive caesium-137 went missing in transportation through Western AustraliaThe source would continue to be radioactive and detectable above natural background radiation levels in the environment for about 300 years, according to Dale Bailey, a professor of medical imaging science at the University of Sydney.In the medical setting, caesium-137 has historically been used in radiotherapy. “One of the biggest sources in a hospital is the blood irradiator – you sterilise blood with the gamma photons from cobalt-60 or caesium before you do a transfusion,” Bailey said.How dangerous is the capsule?Bailey said the missing capsule posed two main hazards to humans: exposure, and the more serious concern, contamination, which occurs when radioactive material comes into contact with something, such as the human body or soil or a road.Tech coalition aiming to create Australian high-powered laser industry with nuclear fusion ambitionsRead more“Exposure is like sitting in the sun on a hot day and getting UV radiation,” he said. “If you limit your time and you maximise your distance from it, then you limit how much exposure you get.”Authorities have said spending an hour at one metre’s distance from the missing capsule was similar to receiving 10 X-rays, but Radiation Services WA estimates the radiation dose is about 17 chest X-rays.It estimates the capsule’s radiation dose is about 1.665 millisieverts an hour. The normal amount of background radiation a person in Australia is exposed to in a year is about 1.5 millisieverts.The capsule’s steel container prevents radioactive material escaping, but if it were to be broken, contamination would be a greater worry.The beta particles – no longer contained by a barrier – could cause serious damage, resulting in reddening of the skin, or ulceration or tissue death in severe cases, Bailey said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ingestion would be very dangerous. Caesium “would go to the bone, because that’s just what caesium does … then you’re going to have continuous radiation by the beta particles and the gamma rays. They’re not going to be eliminated.”“If you swallow this source, you’re likely to get local ulceration in the gut and that can lead to a rupture.”How many similar capsules exist?According to Radiation Services WA, there are thousands of radioactive sources around the state that are used and transported daily without issue.“The Radiological Council of WA or any radiation health unit in any state or territory in Australia, or around the world, knows each and every single source – they have a database,” Steen said. “They would have to go through a federal import process as well.”Transport of sources between locations often requires prior submission of regulatory documents.Most of Australia’s nuclear waste comes from Lucas Heights – should it stay there?Read more“Checks and balances are in place, but it’s probably a bit of a wake up call to all the companies about the serious nature of radioactivity,” Steen said.Caesium-137 capsules are commonly imported, although Bailey said local manufacture would be possible at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation’s (Ansto) nuclear reactor. “It’s a byproduct of the uranium fission reaction,” he said.Steen said: “I’m not aware of anybody who manufactures them in Australia.”The WA Radiological Council was contacted for comment.What happens to nuclear waste?Once they are no longer useful, capsules like the missing source are typically exported if they have been manufactured elsewhere. “Generally speaking, you’re unable to dispose of anything not generated in WA within WA,” Steen said. “Anything that comes from overseas generally goes straight back.”Bailey agreed: “Traditionally in Australia, we’ve sent it back to its source, maybe the US or Canada or Europe.”Most of the nuclear waste Australia does have is stored at Ansto’s facilities at Lucas Heights.In 2020 the Morrison government selected a site near Kimba, South Australia, for a national nuclear waste facility but the decision has faced a legal challenge from Barngarla traditional owners.","**Headline:** Radioactive Capsule: What You Need to Know

99, This article is more than 3 months oldNumber of nesting seabirds on Lundy island at nine-decade highThis article is more than 3 months old,"Tiny island in Bristol Channel has 25,000 Manx shearwaters – 95% of England’s breeding population – and 1,335 puffins ","There are more seabirds nesting on the island of Lundy than at any time since the 1930s, conservationists have revealed.The tiny island in the Bristol Channel, a globally famed location for Britain’s seabirds, is now home to 25,000 Manx shearwaters – 95% of England’s breeding population – as well as 1,335 puffins and more than 150 pairs of storm petrels, a species that only arrived on the island in 2014.Despite the recent threat of avian flu, which has decimated wild bird populations in some of the world’s most sensitive locations, and the problematic decline in wild sources of food such as sand eels, the total number of seabirds on Lundy stood at 40,000 this summer.This is a massive turnaround after just 7,351 remained in 2000. Puffins were close to extinction, with just 13 counted on the windswept 450-hectare island in 2001.Seabirds treble on Lundy after island is declared rat-freeRead moreBut a drive to remove rats from the island has helped numbers to rebound. Black and brown rats, which arrived on Lundy as stowaways on ships over many decades, had been preying on the eggs and chicks, particularly those of burrow-nesting shearwaters and puffins.The rats were eradicated in a partnership led by the RSPB, Natural England, the Landmark Trust and the National Trust between 2002 and 2004 – a move that was opposed at the time by some animal rights groups, who argued that conservationists were favouring tourist-friendly birds over the rats.Since the island was declared rat-free in 2006, its seabird populations have bounced back, as they have on other small islands when invasive predators let loose by humans have been removed.Paul St Pierre, a conservation officer for the RSPB, said: “Partnership projects like this show just how much potential there is to restore species and landscapes on an incredible scale.“If we can restore over 30,000 birds to one small island in the Bristol Channel, just imagine how much could be achieved if everyone came together to restore nature right across the UK.”Manx shearwaters taking off near Lundy. Photograph: National Trust Images/Nick Upton/PAOngoing biosecurity work has ensured no rats have returned to Lundy on boats, while annual surveying has revealed the dramatic population recovery.Global populations of seabirds have fallen by 70% since the 1950s, and in northern Britain most seabird populations have experienced significant declines in recent years. But more southerly summer populations of seabirds that feed in the waters off south Wales and south-west England have largely bucked this downward trend.Derek Green, the general manager of Lundy, said: “We’re delighted by the dramatic increase of seabirds on Lundy in recent years. Conservation is at the heart of everything we do on the island and we look forward to continuing to nurture this very special place for future generations to enjoy.”British coasts are internationally important for many species including puffins, grey seals and Manx shearwaters, with more than 80% of the world’s population nesting in the country.The revival recalls the abundance of the 1930s: in 1939 it was estimated that Lundy was home to 80,000 seabirds.","**Headline:** Discover the Thriving Seabird Sanctuary of Lundy Island
